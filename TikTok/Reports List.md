**Learn more about how TikTok meets its obligations under the Digital Services Act (the 'DSA') and how we strive to foster a fun and inclusive environment where people can create, find community, and be entertained.**

#### **About the Digital Services Act**

The DSA is designed to further strengthen the safety of people on platforms like ours. A key objective of the DSA is to give users of digital services even greater insight into the work we do to keep them safe, and provide them with additional tools – and ultimately, greater choice – over their own experience of the platform.

An important element of this is providing greater transparency about the content moderation activities we engage in.

Very Large Online Platforms under the DSA are required to make publicly available a report which outlines the content moderation activities they engage in. These reports include information on the following:

*   Our approach to content moderation generally (including the training and support we provide to our content moderators).
*   An overview of the kinds of restrictions we impose in response to content and accounts which violate our policies or local laws, either as a result of the content moderation we engage in at our own initiative or in response to law enforcement requests for information and government requests for content removals.
*   An overview of the number of reports we have received through our dedicated ‘illegal content reporting’ channel and the action we have taken in response to those notices.
*   A breakdown of the number of monthly active users in each individual EU Member State.

In addition, amongst our other obligations as a Very Large Online Platform, TikTok is required to identify, analyse and assess any systemic risks in the European Union that stem from the design or functioning of our service and systems, or from the use of our service. The results of this risk assessment are documented in a report, which is published on an annual basis.

Our compliance with the DSA is also subject to annual external independent audit. We publish our external auditor's report on an annual basis. We also publish our audit implementation report that addresses our responses to any recommendations that we receive from our external auditors.

We’re proud of our strong track record of being transparent about the steps we take to keep TikTok safe and entertaining, publishing our first transparency report in [2019](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/en-us/community-guidelines-enforcement-2019-2/), and welcome the opportunity provided by the DSA to further increase transparency about our platform.

#### **Reports**

Building on our proactive approach to transparency and as part of our obligations under the DSA, we will publish a transparency report every six months to provide granular data for EU countries about our content moderation activities. These reports, along with our risk assessment results report, audit and audit implementation reports under the Digital Services Act, are available below.
