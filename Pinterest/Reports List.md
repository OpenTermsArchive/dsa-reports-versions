Audit Report and Audit Implementation Report

Article 37 of the DSA and the Delegated Regulation on Independent Audits require VLOPs to engage an independent auditor to assess compliance with their DSA obligations and commitments each year.  

The independent auditor is required to produce a report detailing its conclusion on each individual DSA obligation and commitment, as well as an overall audit opinion of “Positive,” “Positive with comments,” or “Negative,” along with recommended compliance measures for any conclusion that is not “Positive.”  Pursuant to the Delegated Act, independent auditors are required to reach an overall audit opinion of “Negative” if just one individual obligation is “Negative.”

Following receipt of the Audit Report, VLOPs have one month to adopt an Audit Implementation Report that describes the measures it will take to implement the independent auditor’s recommendations or explain the reasons for not doing so and set out any alternative measures.

Article 42(4) of the DSA requires VLOPs to make both the Audit Report and the Audit Implementation Report publicly available no later than three months after receiving each year’s Audit Report from the auditor. The publicly available reports may be redacted to prevent the disclosure of confidential or sensitive information.

The risk assessments must also take into account certain influencing factors as described in Article 34(2).

Article 42(4) of the DSA requires VLOPs to make publicly available, no later than three months after receiving each year’s Audit Report, a report setting out the results of their risk assessment and the specific mitigation measures put in place.
