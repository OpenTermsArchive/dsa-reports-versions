1\. Executive Summary



Pinterest is a visual search and discovery platform where people find inspiration, curate ideas and shop products — all ina positive place online. At Pinterest, our mission is to bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they love, and that’s ourguiding light for everything we do, from the way we draft and enforce our content and advertising policies to the design ofour platform and new features we launch. Pinterest does not prioritise endless engagement or virality. Our users (“Pinners”)come to Pinterest to find ideas for recipes, beauty, fashion, home decor and more. We believe that safety and protecting ourcommunity is central to creating a positive and inspirational online platform. We have established Community Guidelines asour “rules of the road” that clearly outline what is and isn’t allowed on Pinterest, and we work hard to identify and removeharmful content from our platform.

The Digital Services Act (“DSA”) came into force on 16th November 2022 with the aim of giving better protection to users andto fundamental rights online, establishing a transparency and accountability framework for online platforms, and providinga single, uniform framework across the European Union (“EU”). The DSA requires Pinterest as a Very Large Online Platform(“VLOP”) to identify, analyse, assess and mitigate certain systemic risks stemming from the functioning and use of Pinterestin the EU.

Following our risk assessment framework, we’ve assessed that the overall risk that Pinterest poses to our users and tosociety remains Low. Our second annual systemic risk assessment considered similar factors as our first assessment in 2023,including the reasons that users come to Pinterest, the ways they use the platform and interact with others, and the limitedopportunities for content to go “viral” on Pinterest. For our 2024 assessment, we also considered changes to functionalitieson our platform, updates to our tools and systems, business strategies and priorities, and events in the external environment,such as global elections and the increase in the prevalence and use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (“GenAI”). As before,we also looked at the controls we have in place to prevent these risks from occurring, from our Community Guidelines andother related policies to the robust processes we use to detect and take appropriate action on harmful content and behaviour.

In carrying out this assessment, we conducted interviews and surveyed a broad range of internal Pinterest stakeholders,reviewed internal documentation and leveraged data — including information reported in our global and DSA transparencyreports — and gathered input from a range of external stakeholders, such as users and industry groups. Based on this review,we identified potential risks associated with the design, functioning or use of Pinterest and assessed how these might impactEU users and the broader EU society. We’ve grouped these risks into four main categories:

1. Illegal content;

2. Negative effects for the exercise of fundamental rights;

3. Negative effects on civic discourse, electoral processes and public security; and

4. Negative effects in relation to gender-based violence, the protection of public health and minors, and serious negativeconsequences to the person’s physical and mental well-being.

We’ve also considered if and how Pinterest’s design, functionality or use influence these systemic risks. We consideredPinterest’s overall ecosystem, including: applicable terms and conditions and their enforcement, content moderationsystems, design of recommender systems, systems for selecting and presenting advertisements, related data practices, andintentional manipulation.

Although our current overall assessment of the risk that Pinterest presents to EU users and society is Low, we’re continuouslyimproving our control environment. We’re actively making enhancements to specifically address these four risk categories,including a continued focus on user safety, enhancing our current QA and training programmes, enhancements to our mentalhealth supports, and additional measures to make Pinterest an inspiring and inclusive place for all our users.

User safety remains critical for Pinterest and is championed by our CEO, Bill Ready, both in public and within the company as astrategic priority. The safety of our users is key to the success of our business and we strive to constantly evolve and enforcebetter content safety policies and make deliberate choices to set an example as a more positive place online.

2\. Introduction

2.1 Pinterest

Product Overview



Pinterest is a visual search and discovery platform for finding ideas like recipes, home and style inspiration, and more. Peoplearound the world, including in the EU, use Pinterest to bring ideas to life, shop products and discover inspiring content. Pinnerscome to Pinterest to discover Pins they love and save them to boards to keep their ideas organised and easy to find. Thereare billions of Pins on Pinterest, allowing our users to find ideas to spark inspiration. Pins can be images, videos or products.

Pins can be saved and organised on boards. Pinners can name their boards, arrange them on their profile however they wantand organise their Pins in a way that makes sense to them. They can also invite other people to collaborate on group boardsto find even more ideas. All Pinners have the option to set their profile to private, and private profiles won’t appear in searchresults on Pinterest or in search engines.

A Pinner’s home feed is where we suggest Pins, creators, products and merchants we think they’ll love. The home feed willalso show Pins from the creators and boards they’ve chosen to follow. Users can save, create, share and shop Pins, exploresuggested topics and trends or search for topics of their own, and collaborate with others.



Pinterest’s mission and content approach



At Pinterest, our mission is to bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they love. User safety is critical to our mission,especially when it comes to the safety of young people, and our content moderation practices and Community Guidelinesare always evolving to be current, including to keep up with new behaviours and trends and to create a more positive placeon the internet.

Pinterest is working towards making the internet a safer and healthier place for everyone, especially young people.In partnership with the Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Children’s Hospital, Pinterest helped create and signed theInspired Internet Pledge , which provides a framework for companies to take “meaningful, measurable actions to supportpositive mental and emotional well-being outcomes both on and offline.” The pledge is a call to action for technologycompanies to make the internet a safer and healthier place, and Pinterest is proud to be a founding signatory.



2.2 The Digital Services Act



The goal of the DSA is to “create a safer online experience for citizens to freely express their ideas, communicate and shoponline, by reducing their exposure to illegal activities and dangerous goods and ensuring the protection of fundamentalrights.” 1 Articles 34 and 35 of the DSA lay out the requirements for Pinterest as a VLOP to identify, analyse, assess and mitigatecertain systemic risks stemming from the design, functioning and use of Pinterest in the EU.

This report describes the results of Pinterest’s second DSA systemic risk assessment and associated mitigation measures,including an overview of Pinterest’s risk landscape, ongoing mitigation efforts to address those risks and updates to thefurther mitigation measures we identified in 2023. While most of the policies and controls we discuss in this report are globalin nature, the scope of this report and our risk assessment is limited to the EU.

Pinterest Digital Services Act Risk Assessment and Mitigation Report 20245



2.3 What’s changed since last year?



Our second annual DSA systemic risk assessment remains grounded in our bedrock risk assessment methodology. We’veexamined new risks posed by external events and emerging technology and have incorporated learnings from the first yearof DSA enforcement. For example, this year, we considered new risks associated with global elections, especially those in theEU, and the growing prominence of GenAI. We also considered new Pinterest products and functionalities and provided anupdate on the risk mitigation measures identified in last year’s report.



Global Elections



There are more than 50 elections happening around the world in 2024. Within the EU, there have been national or localelections in 11 member states as well as elections for the European Parliament, and more elections are due to take placebefore the end of the year.

We know that our Pinners don’t come to Pinterest for politics — they come for inspiration on topics like recipes, beautyand home design. Nevertheless, we understand the implications of harmful content related to elections and civic discourseand we strive to make sure that this type of violative content is identified and actioned on our platform. Pinterest has beenon the forefront in this area — since 2018, we have banned political campaign advertising including political candidates,political parties and political issues with intent to influence an election (full information on this can be found in ourAdvertising Guidelines). In addition, our Civic Participation Misinformation policy prohibits false or misleading content onPinterest that impedes an election’s integrity or an individual’s or group’s civic participation, which includes activities likeregistering to vote, voting and being counted in a census.

We have elections-focused teams who closely monitor elections across the globe and work to take proactive and reactivemeasures in response to elections, ensuring our policies and systems remain current. We have also participated in roundtablediscussions on election integrity hosted by the European Commission to review lessons learned from the European electionsand plans for future improvements.

More information on this risk can be found in the discussion of Systemic Risk 3 (Negative effects on civic discourse, electoralprocesses and public security).



Artificial Intelligence



Artificial intelligence (“AI”), and in particular, GenAI, is a technology that has significantly grown in prominence since our lastDSA risk assessment. Pinterest has always used traditional forms of AI (machine learning or machine learning models) as acomponent of our recommender systems and content moderation models. We use human reviewers to train our machinelearning models and we continually monitor and evaluate those models to make sure they’re working as intended.

GenAI is a complex area and has many potential uses, from automating processes to generating new content. In completingthis year’s DSA risk assessment, we took into consideration the targeted and intentional ways in which Pinterest’s productuses GenAI in the EU and what risks stem from such use. At this time, Pinterest does not have GenAI features that allowindividual users to generate content.

Pinterest, in using GenAI, has also taken a number of steps to ensure the safety of our users. For example, for purposes oftraining GenAI models, we do not use images appearing in private Pins or user profile information, and our GenAI systemshave a number of technical safety measures in place.

In looking at the risk of GenAI, we also have to take into account manipulated or edited content that might appear on ourplatform and the existing controls we have to identify this type of harmful content. Our Community Guidelines apply to allcontent on the Pinterest platform regardless of how it has been created. We’ve addressed intentional manipulation for eachof our systemic risks below.

We have also partnered with the Digital Trust and Safety Partnership (“DTSP”) and participated in their GenAI and AutomationsWorking Group. The output for this Working Group will be to publish a paper on best practices for GenAI and automation intrust and safety.

Pinterest Digital Services Act Risk Assessment and Mitigation Report 20246



Further Mitigation Efforts for GenAI



In addition to the controls and mitigation measures already in place for our use of GenAI, we plan to introduce additional riskmitigation measures to guide us and our users in the area of GenAI. The first of these measures is to provide more transparencyto our users and our partners around our approach to responsible use of GenAI. In addition to providing this transparency andthe existing information in our Privacy Policy on machine learning, we’re working on a Help Center article that will be availableto our users and will give them details on what GenAI is, how Pinterest uses GenAI and how this might impact them.

We’re continuing to enhance our content moderation systems, which also enhance our risk mitigation efforts for CommunityGuidelines-violating GenAI-created content.



Updates to our platform



While our mission and values remain the same, we’ve added some new features to our platform to make sure that we continueto be a positive place online where people can find the inspiration to live a life they love.

Since our last risk assessment, we’ve expanded our inclusive product feature offerings with a new feature called body typeranges, which uses our body type technology to give users the choice to self-select what body types are featured in theirsearch results for women’s fashion and wedding ideas.

In addition, we’re leveraging GenAI technology to support creative, improved campaign performance for advertisers by usingGenAI technology to enable creation of scenic lifestyle backgrounds on product images.

We’ve also made it easier for users to share their inspiration with others with our new board sharing feature that lets usersshare dynamic videos of their favourite Pinterest boards to other social platforms.

All of these new features and functionalities have been taken into consideration for the purposes of this year’s risk assessment.



2.4 Updates on 2023 Mitigation Measures



In our 2023 DSA Risk Assessment and Mitigation Report, we identified five areas for additional mitigation measures. Updateson those areas are provided below:



1. Recommender Systems



In last year’s risk assessment, we noted that we had begun to implement methods to ensure that our recommendersystems do not learn from harmful content or bad actors. Since then, we have further enhanced these systems.

Our Trust and Safety team provides our Recommender Systems teams with a daily output of users and content thathave been identified as policy-violating. The Recommender Systems teams then exclude these users and contentfrom model training. This means that Pins, boards and users that have been deactivated due to Community Guidelinesviolations are excluded from the data used by our recommender systems. This process was finalised in Q4 of 2023.Full details on actions taken on policy-violating content are detailed under influencing factor 2.



2. Automated Models



The safety of our users is top of mind for Pinterest. Last year’s risk assessment highlighted that investment in ourmachine learning models was a key component in identifying and actioning harmful content.

Since then, we have continued to invest in and make enhancements to machine learning for content moderation.Since the start of H2 2023, we have launched or updated 16 machine learning models covering categories such asadult content, depressive quotes, child safety, drugs, weapons and eating disorders. We have also expanded ouradult content model to proactively remove adult content from our platform. Since the rollout of this updated model,we have seen a reduction in user reports for adult content. We plan to continue our investments in this area to fightpolicy-violating content on Pinterest.

Pinterest Digital Services Act Risk Assessment and Mitigation Report 20247



3. Third-party experts



Pinterest consults with external third-party experts to identify new and emerging trends in harmful content on ourplatform. We mentioned last year that we had plans to expand our work with these experts and since then, we havemade additional investments with existing third-party experts who provide us with information on possible policy-violating content. In addition to misinformation, elections and child safety, we have expanded the coverage of ourexternal third-party experts to content areas including self-harm, illegal drugs and adult sexual services.

4. Quality assurance



In our 2023 risk assessment, we identified that we needed to enhance our quality assurance (“QA”) programme toensure our enforcement decisions are consistent, accurate and in line with our content moderation policies.

Since last year, we have enhanced our process to calibrate enforcement accuracy between our content moderationoutsourced partners, Pinterest’s content safety enforcement subject-matter experts, and the Pinterest ContentPolicy team. To this end, we introduced a formal Root Cause Analysis and Error Trend Analysis to identify and mitigatethe reasons for incorrect enforcement decisions. In addition, we adjusted both the volume and the mix of differentcontent actions in the quality sample to better represent the total volume of items reviewed. Our QA programmeremains a priority for our Trust \& Safety team and we continue to make investments in our QA team to enhance ourcurrent programme.

5. Supporting mental health and emotional well-being



Pinterest is committed to taking meaningful actions in the service of supporting more positive mental and emotionalwell-being for all people, especially young people. Since last year, we’ve continued our work to help make the interneta more positive place with a focus on public health, minors, and the physical and mental well-being of our users. Werecently completed an external listening tour with mental health experts and a youth council on teen safety. We havealso partnered with a research firm to run co-creation sessions with teens to better centre their lived experience andcreate a digital space that supports who they are and what they envision for themselves. We augmented our existingpartnership with the Mental Health Foundation to continue to address suicide and self-harm content on the platform.We’re also taking steps to make Pinterest a more inclusive platform with the introduction of our body type technologyand the launch of our body type ranges in March 2024. In addition, 70% of our year-to-date strategic giving budgethas been awarded to organisations or projects focused specifically on supporting the mental and emotional well-being of young people. This is an area that Pinterest is committed to and we’ll continue our efforts in this space as wesee the value and impact of our efforts.

Details on our mental health and emotional well-being efforts can be found in our latest ESG Report. We includedetails on our existing, in-product mental health and well-being features, such as compassionate search and searchadvisories later on in this report.

3\. Risk Assessment Methodology

3.1 Understanding Pinterest’s systemic risk landscape



Pinterest considers a systemic risk to be a risk that a platform could be designed, functioning or used (or misused) in a waythat could cause serious harm or have serious negative consequences for the platform’s users in the EU.

Although there have been changes to the external environment and our product that will impact the 2024 DSA risk assessment,many of the controls we describe are similar to those described last year. We have included additional information where wehave made improvements and updates.



Systemic Risk Categories



Similar to last year, in order to identify the risks that Pinterest could present to users in the EU, we reviewed and updated ourrisk register. We started this process by reviewing the risk register from 2023 to make sure that those risks remained relevant.We made updates to these existing risks where required. In addition, we looked at internal and external factors that couldhave an impact on our risk register, such as changes to the Pinterest product or new functionalities, external events such asglobal elections and the prominence of GenAI, and how these factors impact how harm can manifest on the platform.

We assessed each systemic risk individually and aggregated them into four risk categories:

1. Illegal content;

2. Negative effects on the exercise of fundamental rights;

3. Negative effects on civic discourse, electoral processes and public security; and

4. Negative effects in relation to gender-based violence, the protection of public health and minors, and serious negativeconsequences to the person’s physical and mental well-being.

Given the volume of content on the Pinterest platform, detecting and taking appropriate action on harmful content cannotcompletely eliminate these four risk areas. There are inherent risks on any platform that deals with vast quantities of contentand data. Pinterest takes a risk-based approach when it comes to content moderation, prioritising harms that pose thegreatest potential risk and balancing fundamental rights with keeping users safe.



Influencing Factors



We’ve also considered if and how Pinterest’s design, functionality or use influence these systemic risks. We’ve focusedon the following influencing factors (the “influencing factors”) and have taken other potential influencing factors—such asmanipulation and amplification—into account where deemed relevant:

1. Applicable terms and conditions and their enforcement;

2. Content moderation systems;

3. Design of recommender systems and any other relevant algorithmic systems;

4. Systems for selecting and presenting advertisements;

5. Related data practices; and

6. Intentional manipulation

These influencing factors encapsulate Pinterest’s full platform ecosystem and we’ve assessed each factor as part of thisrisk assessment.

Pinterest Digital Services Act Risk Assessment and Mitigation Report 20249



3.2 Risk Assessment Methodology



Based on our understanding of Pinterest’s systemic risk landscape and our risk register as described in the Systemic RiskCategories section, we evaluated our systemic risks by analysing a variety of sources, including:

• Interviews: We conducted ~30 interviews with a wide range of internal Pinterest stakeholders.

• Questionnaires: We collected information from 14 questionnaires sent to 30 internal Pinterest stakeholders.

• Documentation: We reviewed internal documentation, such as policies, procedures and other control documentation.

• Metrics and other data: We leveraged data and other information included in our most recent Global TransparencyReport (H2 2023), which contains information on our efforts to keep our platform safe and inspiring, such as thenumber of Pin removals and account deactivations, and our most recent DSA Transparency Reports (reportingperiods 25 September 2023 to 31st December 2023), which contain information specific to EU users content.

• Input from external stakeholders: We leveraged input from our users, risk experts, experts in specific types of harm,industry groups and independent civil society organisations. For example, Pinterest attended the EU Rights \& RisksForum, hosted by the DTSP and Global Network Initiative, which brought together representatives from VLOPs andSearch Engines (VLOSEs), as well as civil society and academic experts from across Europe and other jurisdictions todiscuss systemic risk assessments as provided for in the DSA. Over the course of two days of panels and workshops,Forum participants explored DSA risk assessments and their potential impact on fundamental rights. The Forum wasdesigned to inform approaches to risk assessment and stakeholder engagement, but not to constitute the totality ofany company’s assessment or engagement.

For each risk on our risk register, we assessed:

• Inherent risk rating: the level of risk that exists if left untreated. To determine this rating for each risk, we considered:

• Severity: the impact that it would have on user groups and EU society in general. Each risk was assigned aseverity rating of Marginal, Moderate, Significant or Critical.

• Probability: the likelihood that the impact will occur. Each risk was assigned a probability rating of Unlikely,

Possible, Likely or Almost Certain.

Based on both the severity and probability ratings, each risk was assigned an inherent risk rating of Low, Medium,

High or Very High. (See the Appendix for additional information on these ratings.)

• Control effectiveness: Using our control library, we identified the controls and safeguards in place to mitigate eachrisk and determined how effective the control environment is in mitigating the inherent systemic risk. In order toassess the effectiveness of controls, we used data and metrics where available, as well as preliminary auditobservations identified by both our Internal Audit team and our independent external auditors who carried out testingof our DSA controls. Our Compliance team was responsible for overseeing this testing. We plan to use the resultsof the independent audit as part of the DSA risk assessment in future years. Each control was assigned a controleffectiveness rating of Ineffective, Somewhat Effective, Effective or Highly Effective.

• Residual risk: the level of risk remaining once the controls and mitigations have been considered. Based on theinherent risk rating and control effectiveness ratings, each risk was assigned a residual risk rating of Low, Medium,

High or Very High.

While we assessed each risk individually, we grouped the risks into four systemic risk categories (see above) and reported onthe aggregate risk ratings and control effectiveness scores.

See the Appendix for additional information on our risk assessment methodology.

4\. Pinterest’s platform ecosystem



At Pinterest, our mission is to bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they love, and it’s our “guiding light” in drafting andenforcing our content policies. Our moderation practices are always evolving to keep up with new behaviours and trends andto create a more positive place on the internet for the people on our platform. We continue to invest heavily in measures likemachine learning technology to fight policy-violating content on Pinterest and work with outside experts and organisations,including civil society, charities, user groups and academics to inform our policies and content moderation practices. We areproud of our policies and practices because they’re the right things for the people on our platform. They help Pinterest to bea more positive and inspiring place online.

Each element of Pinterest’s ecosystem has been developed with safety as a guiding principle. As part of this risk assessment,we’ve analysed the potential impact these elements — or “influencing factors” — could have on each of the systemic riskcategories. Before we dive into the results of the assessment, we’ll first provide an overview of each of these elements.



4.1 Influencing factor 1: Applicable terms and conditions and their enforcement

Policies and guidelines



To help us cultivate a positive and inspired community, we develop and enforce content policies that help in our aim to ensureour platform is a positive place where people can find real-life ideas as to what to try, cook, wear or do next. This includes:

• Terms of Service: terms users agree to when using Pinterest

• Business Terms of Service: governs business access to and use of Pinterest

• Community Guidelines: what we do and don’t allow on Pinterest

• Merchant Guidelines: requirements for merchants operating on Pinterest

• Advertising Guidelines: standards for creating ads

• Advertising Services Agreement: the terms advertisers agree to when advertising on Pinterest

• Privacy Policy: information we collect, how we use it and users’ options

• Copyright and Trademark policies: information on how we expect Pinners to respect the intellectual property rightsof third parties, and how rights holders can protect their rights on Pinterest

• Enforcement: how we put our policies into practice, including any restrictions that we may apply to users’ content oruse of Pinterest

• Developer Guidelines: guidelines for building with Pinterest materials

These policies and guidelines are applicable globally, meaning that they apply to all users, businesses, merchants andadvertisers who use our platform. For our policies, we’ve built in nuances for local legislation and regulations, and they’retranslated and available in 45 languages. We want to make sure that our Pinners understand our policies the first time theyread them, so we use plain language along with short summaries to make our policies accessible.

All of our policies and guidelines are available on our Policy Page and are also searchable through our Help Center, making themeasily available to Pinners and others. Our Policy team, alongside our Legal team, is responsible for drafting and maintainingPinterest’s policies and guidelines. We continue to engage with external parties to get input and feedback on any new policiesor major updates to existing policies to make sure that new and updated policies do not have a disproportionately negativeeffect on certain user groups. These third parties can include non-profit organisations, independent experts, civic groupsand our Pinners.

Pinterest Digital Services Act Risk Assessment and Mitigation Report 202411

We also have internal-facing enforcement guidelines for our content review teams and automated content review models toidentify and action violating content. These enforcement guidelines align with our Community Guidelines and other publicly-facing policies and are designed to provide more nuance and details for our content review teams and systems to properlyidentify prohibited content and take appropriate enforcement action. We monitor these enforcement guidelines closely andaim to make sure that they are effective and resulting in the correct enforcement actions.

We have an agile and streamlined approach to revising and updating these policies so that we can quickly adapt to new andemerging harm types and make any adjustments that need to be made based on the results of monitoring and QA.

We explain how we enforce our content policies in Influencing factor #2.



4.2 Influencing factor 2: Content moderation systems



Pinterest has a robust content moderation enforcement framework in place to identify and take action on harmful content onour site. The foundation of this framework is our content policies, which are comprised of both our external policies and ourinternal enforcement guidelines. Building on this foundation, we use different methods to enforce these policies, includingreporting by users and our own identification and enforcement models, which include automated, manual and hybridenforcement. Further details on these are set out below.

We take action on harmful, violating and/or illegal content by blocking, removing or limiting the distribution of content, anddeactivating the accounts of individuals and groups that create or spread harmful content and behaviour. The type of actionwe take is based on how much harm the violating content or behaviour poses. We may deactivate an account either after asingle violation if a policy violation is severe enough or if we determine that the account has repeatedly posted policy-violatingor illegal content or displayed signs of unacceptable behaviour. For Pinners who repeatedly post content that violates ourpolicies and guidelines, we have a strike system in place, which could result in the deactivation of a Pinner’s account. Ourpolicies and the methods we use to enforce them are always evolving to keep up with new behaviours and trends. Additionalinformation on potential enforcement action can be found on our enforcement page.



Reporting harmful content and behaviour



Pinterest provides several ways to report content that are easily located, directly accessible and always available.



Reporting Policy Violations



Our reporting options allow our users to tell us if they think something on Pinterest is in violation of our policies. Pinners canreport any Pin, account, board, comment or message they believe is in violation of Pinterest’s policies and guidelines. Thisprocess is available across all Pinterest surfaces (i.e., website, iOS, Android) and in all Pinterest-supported languages.

There are two ways that Pinners can make a report to us: in-product or through our Help Center using the “Report somethingon Pinterest” link. If a user is logged in, they can click on the three small dots located directly on the content (whether it’s a Pinin the home feed, in a close-up of a Pin, on a board, account, comment or message). There are multiple reporting options forthe user to choose from, including policy-violating content and intellectual property infringements (e.g., copyright, trademark)in addition to local EU law violations for EU users, as described below. Depending on the reason for the report, the user maybe asked for additional details and to confirm the report. Where suitable, their report will then be directed to the appropriatereview team. The report will be reviewed against our policies and for illegality when applicable. Our enforcement guidelinesassist review teams to properly identify violating, prohibited or illegal content and take the appropriate enforcement action.The review teams receive specialised training — both at onboarding and ongoing training — to keep up to date with new andemerging trends in harmful and violating content as well as any changes to our policies.

If a user reports content for violation of our copyright or trademark policies, they are directed to a dedicated reporting formdesigned to request all the information required for the Intellectual Property Operations team to review the report. Thecopyright and trademark reporting forms are also available to non-users in our Help Center. If a violation is confirmed, therelevant specialised operations agent will take action on the content as appropriate.

Pinterest Digital Services Act Risk Assessment and Mitigation Report 202412



Reports under local law



For people in the EU, we additionally provide a dedicated reporting channel where they can report content on Pinterestthey believe to be illegal under EU or Member State law. This reporting channel is available both in-product and through theHelp Center, and is available to users and non-users alike. The form is available in the EU languages of countries in which Pinterestis available. For in-product reports, users may choose the option to “Report Pin for EU local law violation.” When choosing thisoption, they will be directed automatically to a dedicated reporting form asking them to provide more information about theirreport and why they believe the content to be illegal. When reporting via the in-product reporting flow, the reporting formwill be automatically populated with the URL to the reported content. The reporting form can also be accessed from ourHelp Center.

Reports submitted via this designated channel are reviewed by agents on the Trust \& Safety team who are specially trainedto review certain policy violation reports and/or reports under local law. The content is reviewed, and if the content is foundto violate our policies, action is taken on the content globally. If content is determined to violate local law but not removed forviolation of our policies, the content is blocked in the relevant jurisdiction or region where it is considered unlawful.

We also have dedicated channels through which government authorities may request the removal of content they considerto be unlawful or in violation of our policies. These reports are submitted via a designated email alias (abuse@pinterest.com)and are reviewed by specialists on the Law Enforcement \& Government Operations team. Where content is found to beviolative of our policies, appropriate action is taken globally; if not otherwise policy-violating, content that is confirmed to belocally unlawful is blocked in the relevant jurisdiction. The Law Enforcement \& Government Operations team is also trainedand tasked with responding to legal and emergency requests from law enforcement for user information. This team aims toprotect Pinners and their data by balancing our legal obligations with user privacy.

We have several controls in place to ensure the integrity of our reporting channels and we use these controls to identify andrestrict or prevent the processing of reports from people who abuse our reporting channels. For example, to prevent abuse,we may limit the number of reports that one person can submit in a specific time period. In accepting our Terms of Service,our users agree to submit reports in good faith and not misuse any reporting or appeals channel by making baseless reportsor appeals.



Enforcement Systems



In addition to our reporting tools and channels, we enforce our policies through various enforcement models, which includeautomated tools, manual review and a hybrid approach that incorporates elements of both. These systems may use machinelearning as well as logic-based rules. Where appropriate, we may take into account information provided by trusted thirdparties and industry tools.



Automated Enforcement Tools



Our automated tools use a combination of signals to identify and take action against potentially violating content. For example,our machine learning models assign scores to content added to our platform. Our automated tools can then use those scoresto perform appropriate enforcement actions. We use our automated tools for many specific types of harmful and policy-violating content: adult content, child safety (including sexualization of minors), civic and electoral integrity, graphic violence,hate speech, illegal drugs, medical misinformation, self-harm, and spam.

We are constantly working to improve our automated models. We use the latest modelling techniques and continuously iterateon these models. By adding new data and exploring new technical breakthroughs, we maintain or improve their performanceover time to effectively address violative content.

To control the quality of a machine learning model, we evaluate the performance of that model through offline analysis andonline experiments before launching. We look at a number of metrics to review the effectiveness of our models, both prior toand subsequent to launch of the model. We regularly review data and other relevant information to continually identify areasfor improvement that our teams investigate and address as appropriate.

Where and when our automated tools detect policy-violating content, it will remove, limit the distribution or send the contentfor manual review. To balance the fundamental rights of users, we have a process for Pinners to appeal if they think that acontent restriction taken for a policy violation has been in error.

Pinterest Digital Services Act Risk Assessment and Mitigation Report 202413



Manual Enforcement Actions



We manually act on some Pins and boards through our human review process. Pins actioned through this process may includethose identified internally, those reported to us by third parties and those reported to us by users and non-users.

Pinterest uses manual review teams to receive and take appropriate action on reports of harmful and illegal content andbehaviour on our platform. We have in-house moderators and we work with global external partners that support scalabilityin different languages and time zones. Agents go through a robust training programme at onboarding, followed by regularongoing and ad hoc training. The agents also have access to PinU, our self-guided training portal. When there are updates topolicies or guidelines, additional training is provided to agents.

The team consists of specialists trained in Pinterest’s policies. In the event of a complex report, a team member can escalatequestions to Pinterest team leads. These team leads may in turn consult further with specialists at Pinterest and designatedreview partners that have expertise in the laws of the EU and its member states.

Though Pinterest is primarily a visual platform, all review agents speak at least one EU Member state language. We also haveexternal resources available to assist with any languages not spoken by agents.

Our external partners are responsible for following quality processes implemented by Pinterest’s QA programme. Thisprogramme focuses on verifying the accuracy and consistency of enforcement decisions. Since last year, we’ve made someenhancements to our QA programme, with our goal being to further enhance this programme to make sure our enforcementdecisions and actions are consistent, accurate and in line with our policies and enforcement guidelines. Further details onthese enhancements can be found here. We monitor the results of our QA programme and we may implement additionalcontrols, enhance our training programme or make changes to our enforcement guidelines based on the results.



Hybrid Enforcement Actions



Hybrid actions include those where a team member determines that a Pin violates policy and automated systems help expandthat decision to enforce against machine-identified matching Pins. Depending on the volume of matching Pins, a hybrid actionmay result in a number of Pins actioned or none at all.



Other enforcement mechanisms



Third-party experts



Pinterest engages with external third-party experts to provide additional content moderation support. These third partiesare experts in specific harm types, they keep us informed of industry trends and help us detect whether those trends areoccurring on Pinterest. The new and emerging trends and other signals we receive from these experts are reviewed andwhere appropriate, we build these trends and signals into our content moderation tools. We may also carry out targetedenforcement efforts based on signals provided by these third parties and update our moderation tools based on the resultsof those enforcement efforts.

Since last year’s risk assessment, we’ve made additional investments with our existing third-party experts to expand thescope of their coverage and entered into additional partnerships with new third-party vendors to include additional types ofharm. Further details on these new measures are here.



Managed list of sensitive terms



We also maintain a list of sensitive terms and phrases (Sensitive Terms List or “STL”), which is used to block search resultsor prevent content from appearing in recommendations where it may violate our policies, such as terms associated withchild safety, self-harm, suicide, drug abuse and eating disorders. In response to searches containing certain terms, whereappropriate, we display an advisory that connects users with resources if they or someone they know are in crisis or providesuseful and authoritative information about an important topic. Our STL is continually expanding as we identify online trends,both internally and with the support of third-party experts. We’re also expanding our work with external expert third partiesso that our users have access to higher quality resources if they are in crisis. Further information on this can be found here.

Pinterest Digital Services Act Risk Assessment and Mitigation Report 202414



Notification and appeals

Notification



The Reports and Violations Center (“RVC”) is the central place for Pinners to see updates on content that they have reportedas well as content restrictions on the Pinner’s account based on our policies or local law.

Pinners will receive a daily email alerting them to new violations or updates to content they have reported. The email directsthe Pinner to the RVC, which provides additional information and, where applicable, a detailed Statement of Reason forcontent restrictions.

If a Pinner believes that we’ve made the wrong decision on a report or a content restriction, they can submit an appeal withinsix months of being notified of our decision.

Additional notifications may be sent via email rather than through the RVC. For example, people who report content theybelieve to be locally unlawful through our designated reporting channel first receive an acknowledgement of our receipt oftheir report via email, and then receive another email with a more detailed response outlining the results of our review of thereport. Certain other content restriction decisions for which users receive Statements of Reasons are currently also sent viaemail, such as notifications of the outcome of intellectual property reports (copyright infringement, trademark infringement)and notifications of content restrictions based on our Advertising Guidelines and Merchant Guidelines.



Decision appeals process



Appeals are how users can tell us if they think we made an enforcement error. Appeals can be submitted via the Help Center,by clicking the one-click appeal link in an enforcement notice email that was sent to the user, or, where applicable, directlythrough the RVC for content restriction decisions or decisions on reports they’ve submitted. We review appeals requestsand update our enforcement decision if we determine that we made a mistake. Appeals availability may vary for someproduct features or in some localities; in addition, some Pinners may have additional appeal options or mechanisms undertheir local law.

Similar to reports, we may limit appeals; for example, we may suspend the processing of appeals from people who frequentlysubmit unfounded or abusive appeals, and we may limit the number of times that a particular decision can be appealed. Wemay also use automation to handle appeals more efficiently, for example, by expanding a decision made on one Pin to othermachine-identified similar Pins. We also inform Pinners in the EU of their opportunity to seek further review by a certified out-of-court dispute settlement body.



Content moderation system integrity



Pinterest has processes in place to ensure that any new functionalities or products that are developed are assessedfor any potential risk and impact on user safety. For any new product or functionality that is being launched, we have aLaunch Readiness programme to ensure that our Trust \& Safety team can assess the potential impact on user safety andPinterest’s content moderation tools and recommend changes where necessary. As required by the DSA, for any new productor functionality that is being launched in the EU, we also have a process where the Compliance and Legal teams work withcross-functional internal partners to conduct a risk assessment on the functionality if it is likely to have a critical impact onsystemic risk in the EU.

Pinterest also has processes in place to regularly review and update our Community Guidelines and other content policies toensure that new and emerging types of harm are considered by our overall content moderation system. Our newly-establishedRisk Intelligence Engineering team is focused on proactive identification of Trust and Safety risks on our platform. This teammonitors internal and external data sources and translates data anomalies into actionable insights that inform our policies,guidelines and machine learning models. When updates are made to our policies and guidelines, our policy, operations andengineering teams work in tandem to disseminate these changes throughout the content moderation ecosystem. This caninclude delivering new training and updating training decks, enforcement guidelines and automated models.

Pinterest Digital Services Act Risk Assessment and Mitigation Report 202415



Transparency reporting



Pinterest publishes biannual global Transparency reports, which outline the actions we take to uphold our CommunityGuidelines. The transparency reports contain information on our content moderation efforts globally as well as insights intothe volume of information and removal requests we receive from law enforcement and government entities. Only the datarequired for each transparency report is gathered — all data is anonymous and no sensitive data is used for the purposes ofthese reports.

In addition, pursuant to the DSA’s requirements, Pinterest publishes DSA transparency reports at least every six monthsthat provide information on our content moderation activities in the EU. Similar to our global transparency reports, all data isanonymous and no sensitive data is published.



4.3 Influencing factor 3: Design of recommender systems and any other relevantalgorithmic systems



Rather than optimising for view time, Pinterest is focused on creating positive outcomes for users by helping them go fromonline inspiration to offline reality. Pinterest’s users are looking to plan what’s next, and our goal is to help them take action.People use Pinterest to visualise their future, from everyday decisions like what to make for dinner, to celebrating specialmoments like birthday parties and holidays, to planning for life milestones like a new baby. This is reflected in Pinterest’s mostcommon use cases, which include food and drink, fashion, home decor, crafting, and do-it-yourself projects.

Pinterest’s recommender systems are designed to prioritise high-quality and inspirational content. We do this by tuning ourrecommender systems to prioritise explicit user signals — not just views alone — for example, “saves,” in which a user saves aPin to a board. We don’t prioritise unlimited views and time spent on our platform. Saved Pins are more likely to be inspirationaland useful content that the user intends to return to later, such as step-by-step guides, self-care ideas or inspirational quotes.Because of the choices we make in designing our Recommender Systems, Pinterest’s subsequent recommendations to theuser will be tuned to this type of content.

Our Pinners have the ability to fine-tune the recommendations they receive. Pinners can tune their home feed to customise theirpreferences. For example, users can limit specific topics of interest when they no longer wish to see those recommendations.Pinners can also hide individual Pins from their home feed or unfollow the board, topic or account that the Pin came from. Inaddition, Pinners in the EU have the ability to opt out of personalised organic recommendations that use inferred signals.

As well as surfacing positive content, we also tune our machine learning models to de-emphasise low quality content. Inaddition, Pinterest utilises a workflow that captures Pins, boards and users that have been deactivated due to content safetypolicy violations and excludes them from the data used by recommendation models to help prevent these systems fromrecommending similarly unsafe content. Pinterest also uses a machine learning model that is designed to identify contentthat — while not policy-violating — may be harmful, such as depressive quotes or racy content. We then filter or downrankthis content from recommendation surfaces. If a user does click on a Pin that has been identified by this model, related Pinsare not displayed beneath the Pin.

Pinterest utilises non-engagement signals, such as in-app surveys (where users can tell us about their experience on theplatform) or independent assessments of content quality, which are usually generated by manual labelling. These non-engagement signals provide a balance to engagement signals in our content ranking and also help us put our values intoaction. For example, our industry-leading inclusive products have relied heavily on non-engagement signals, as they providerecommendations based on direct user feedback on the body type, hair pattern or skin tone they want to prioritise in theirfeed. Pinterest is passionate about this work, publishing a “field guide” earlier this year to assist other companies interestedin adopting this technology.

Pinterest Digital Services Act Risk Assessment and Mitigation Report 202416



4.4 Influencing factor 4: Systems for selecting and presenting advertisements



Our Advertising Guidelines help our advertisers promote inspiring content on Pinterest in line with our mission, and alladvertisers are subject to these guidelines. These guidelines include information on the categories of ads that are prohibitedand restricted. They also contain country-specific guidelines that must be followed when targeting users in those countries.

We want Pinterest to be a positive and inspiring place for everyone, so there are some areas where our Advertising Guidelinesgo further than what is prohibited by law. For example, we don’t allow political campaign advertising, ads that body shame orads containing adult content.

Pinterest is transparent when it comes to advertising, with ads clearly labelled as ‘Sponsored’ or ‘Promoted By’ to distinguishthem from organic content. Pinterest also allows Pinners to see why they are being shown an ad via the Why Am I Seeing thisAd (“WAISTA”) feature. WAISTA provides Pinners with information about who is presenting an ad and the main parametersused to determine why they were shown an ad. Pinterest’s Ads Repository makes all ads served in the EU in the last yearpublicly available and provides additional information about an ad, such as how it was targeted to audiences. This allows foradditional transparency on the ads being served on the Pinterest platform.

Pinterest uses a mixture of manual review and other controls to enforce our Advertising Guidelines. Pinterest takes a risk-based approach to reviewing ads. A portion of ads are reviewed prior to being served on our platform. Most reviews aremanual and ads that violate our Advertising Guidelines will be rejected. In addition to the manual review of ads, we use toolingto auto-review duplicate ads.

Unlike standard ads that can be content that drives users to any type of landing page an advertiser wants to promote,shopping ads drive directly to a shopping experience. Shopping ads are derived from a product catalogue that allows usersto directly purchase a product. Due to the volume and relative risk level of these ads, they are not manually reviewed priorto being served on the platform. However, additional controls are in place to prevent these ads from containing illegal orharmful content. This includes user reports, which will trigger a manual review of an ad. Users repeatedly hiding an ad willalso trigger a review. Pinterest also deploys machine learning models to detect certain categories of prohibited products thatappear in ads. Once identified, these will be manually reviewed and taken down if they are confirmed to violate Pinterest’sAdvertising Guidelines.



4.5 Influencing factor 5: Data practices



Pinterest’s Privacy Policy governs our data practices. We gather data from our Pinners so that we can show them personalisedcontent and ads we think they’ll be interested in. We will only use that information where we have a proper legal basis fordoing so.

When our Pinners sign up for and use Pinterest, they choose to share information with us, such as their name, birthdate, emailaddress, photos, Pins, comments and other information they choose to share.

We collect technical information from our Pinners when they use Pinterest including log data, cookie data, device information,and clickstream data and inferences. We also get information about our Pinners and their activities outside of Pinterest fromour affiliates, advertisers, partners and other third parties we work with. We use all of the data that we collect from our Pinnersto show them content that is relevant, interesting, inspirational and personal to them. Additionally, we use this information tokeep Pinterest and our Pinners safe.

Our Pinners have choices about how we use their information. Pinners can edit information in their profile at any time, link orunlink their Pinterest account from other services, choose whether Pinterest uses information from their engagement withadvertisers to personalise the ads they see and close their account at any time. Pinners can adjust their cookie settings andchoose how and whether their photos and other data is shared with Pinterest.

Details of the data we collect and the way we use it are set out in our Privacy Policy, which is easily accessible. Logged-in usersof Pinterest can also adjust their privacy settings according to their preferences in their privacy and data settings. This allowsusers to manage the data Pinterest shares with external parties, update their cookie preferences, adapt their personalisationsettings, request a copy of the information Pinterest collects about them and delete their account or information, consistentwith applicable laws.

Pinterest Digital Services Act Risk Assessment and Mitigation Report 202417

Pinterest has a number of different systems in place to both process and store Pinner data. Some of these systems areproprietary to Pinterest and others are provided by third parties. Where third-party systems are in use, Pinterest has controlsin place to prevent Pinners’ personal data from being accessed by these third-party providers. Pinterest also has a numberof controls in place to prevent external data breaches, including a bug bounty programme, penetration exercises and opensource scanning. Internally, Pinterest has an Acceptable Use Policy that governs the ways in which employees and contractorscan access Pinner data, including limiting access as narrowly as possible to those with a legitimate business need.



4.6 Influencing Factor 6: Intentional Manipulation



Our Community Guidelines govern our practices for dealing with intentional manipulation and outline that we do not permitspam or engaging in spammy behaviour, fake accounts or fabricated or meaningfully manipulated visual or audio content thaterodes trust or causes harm.

Unfortunately, bad actors may seek to manipulate the Pinterest platform, including using spam attacks, bad actors using fakeaccounts or by distributing false or misleading content. Account Takeovers (“ATOs”) can also occur on the Pinterest platform,which is where attackers gain access to existing accounts (for example, through stolen login credentials). Rather than creatingfake accounts to spam users, attackers can take over existing accounts.

Pinterest utilises machine learning technology and has built automated models that swiftly detect and act against spam.These models are iterated on a regular basis by adding new data and exploring new technical breakthroughs to either maintainor improve their performance over time to effectively address spam. Logic-based rules and machine learning models areused to detect potential manipulation by analysing patterns in real-time, daily and weekly intervals. When these accounts areidentified, they are deactivated. Users have the ability to appeal these decisions. Users can also report content and profilesfor suspicions of spam.

Pinterest’s most recent DSA Transparency Report (reporting period 25th September 2023 to 31st December 2023) showsthat we deactivated over 500,000 accounts for engaging in violative behaviours, such as distributing spam. We received justover 16,000 appeals as a result of these deactivations, demonstrating the effectiveness of our controls in identifying andactioning spam.

If we think a Pinner’s account has been taken over by a spammer (an ATO), we take measures to protect the account. Thismeans that we log the Pinner out of the existing session, invalidate their password and send them an email asking them toreset their password. Once they reset their password and log back in, they will regain access to their account.

For intentional manipulation in the form of fabricated or meaningfully manipulated content that is harmful, our contentmoderation tools are equipped to identify and action all types of harmful content regardless of how the harmful content iscreated. Full details on our content moderation systems can be found under influencing factor 2.

Pinterest Digital Services Act Risk Assessment and Mitigation Report 202418



5\. Systemic Risk Landscape



In order to understand the systemic risks that Pinterest might pose to EU users and society, we identified and assessed a widerange of individual risks associated with each of the systemic risk categories. We have reported on these risks at a rolled-up,aggregated level across four categories of systematic risk.

This section provides a summary of each of these systemic risks, the controls we have in place to mitigate these risks andwhat we plan to do to further mitigate these risks. In assessing each of the individual risks, we have analysed the:

1. Inherent risk: the level of risk that exists if left untreated. We have considered the severity of the risk and the probabilityof the impact occurring;

2. Controls and other mitigation approaches currently in place to address each risk; and

3. Residual risk: the level of risk leftover once the controls and mitigations have been considered.

We have also considered if and how Pinterest’s design, functionality or use influences these systemic risks. These influencingfactors encapsulate Pinterest’s full platform ecosystem and we have assessed each factor as part of this risk assessment.



5.1 Systemic Risk 1: Illegal ContentSummary



Risk Overview



We have not made changes to the definition of “illegal content” that we used in our 2023 systemic risk assessment; we stilluse the DSA’s definition, which is “any information that, in itself or in relation to an activity, including the sale of products or theprovision of services, is not in compliance with Union law or the law of any Member State which is in compliance with Unionlaw, irrespective of the precise subject matter or nature of that law.”

This is a broad concept and can potentially manifest in multiple ways on the Pinterest platform. To assess the risk of illegalcontent, we have looked at the categories of our Community Guidelines that most align to the concept of illegal content andare most likely to include potentially illegal content. When looking at the risk of illegal content appearing on the Pinterestplatform, we have focused on the following types of policy violations: adult content, adult sexual services, child safety,dangerous goods and activities, graphic violence and threats, harassment and criticism, hateful activities, and violent actors.We have also expanded the types of harm within these categories to capture new and emerging harm types with a focus onchild safety and adult content.

Pinterest Digital Services Act Risk Assessment and Mitigation Report 202419

While these policies are not limited to illegal content (i.e., they often will be broader and stricter than what may be permittedunder local law), they may be seen as signals that indicate the potential risk of illegal content on Pinterest. For these categoriesof policy violations, we have considered these risks individually, assessing the likelihood that this content appears on thePinterest platform, the volume of this content and the differing severity levels that each type of content could cause for users.In this assessment, we have reported on the risk of illegal content at an overall level, however, we acknowledge that withinthis broad category, risk levels differ.



Inherent risk rating

Inherent Risk - Probability



Similar to last year, we have assessed the probability of the risk of illegal content stemming from the design, functioning oruse of Pinterest in the EU as Possible. We know from our detection mechanisms such as user reports, that it is possible forusers to be exposed to policy-violating or illegal content on Pinterest, however briefly, but the volume and spread of suchcontent is relatively low. We also examined how the way this risk presents itself on the platform might have changed since ourlast risk assessment, and expanded the types of harm within this category to capture new and emerging harm types.

For example, as described in our most recently published DSA Transparency Report (reporting period 25th September2023 to 31st December 2023), we removed the following numbers of user-reported violations of a particular content policyin the EU:



Content Policy Number of EU user reports that resulted in removal of Pin(s)



Adult Content 7,411

Adult Sexual Services 3

Child Safety 1,233

Dangerous Goods \& Activities 231

Graphic Violence \& Threats 728

Harassment \& Criticism 161

Hateful Activities 960

Violent Actors 149

Although these policies are not limited to illegal content and these metrics do not necessarily reflect content determined tobe illegal, these metrics do indicate that the number of users exposed to illegal content are low.

In addition to reports of violations of particular content policy, we also receive reports of illegal content through our EuropeanUnion Illegal Content Reporting Form. Between 25th September 2023 and 31st December 2023, as a result of reports receivedthrough our illegal content reporting form alleging that certain content was illegal according to the laws of the EU and/or itsmember states, we removed 247 Pins, boards, accounts and comments for policy violations and 30 Pins, boards, accountsand comments were blocked within the relevant territory for illegal content. All of these reports were reviewed manually.These metrics indicate a very low number of Pins with potentially illegal content in the EU and therefore a low probability ofthe likelihood of exposure to our EU users.

We also receive requests from government entities to remove content on Pinterest that may be illegal in their country and/or aviolation of our Community Guidelines. We review the requests to determine if the content identified violates our CommunityGuidelines or local law. Our teams take action on violations, ranging from removing the content globally to blocking the contentwithin the relevant country if it appears to violate local law but does not violate our policies. During the reporting period 25thSeptember 2023 to 31st December 2023, we did not receive any government removal orders from member states of the EU.

Pinterest Digital Services Act Risk Assessment and Mitigation Report 202420



Inherent Risk - Severity



Similar to last year, we have assessed the severity of the inherent risk of illegal content if left unchecked stemming from thedesign, functioning or use of Pinterest in the EU as Significant primarily because even limited exposure to illegal content for asmall number of users could lead to harm or consequences.

However, the rapid and widespread dissemination of content or content “going viral” is not common on Pinterest. This iscritical to understanding the severity of this risk for EU users and society. In order to understand how uncommon this ison Pinterest, we use the concept of “reach,” which is one of our key indicators of user experience. To calculate this metric,we start by looking at each policy-violating Pin removed in a reporting period. Then, we count the number of unique usersthat saw each of those Pins during the reporting period for at least one second before it was removed. For example, wecan look at our most recent Global Transparency Report (covering the period July 2023 - December 2023), and of the Pinsremoved for violating our Graphic Violence \& Threats policy during the period, 90% were seen by 10 or fewer users during thereporting period and 91% of Pins removed for violating our Hateful Activities Policy were seen by 10 or fewer users during thereporting period.

Based on these metrics across our policies that aim to combat illegal content, rapid dissemination of this content is notcommon on Pinterest due to the nature of the platform.



Overall inherent risk rating



Based on the probability and severity ratings, we have assessed the inherent risk of illegal content stemming from the design,functioning or use of Pinterest posing harm to users and EU society as Medium. There has been no change to the inherent riskrating since the 2023 risk assessment.



Controls and mitigation efforts



Pinterest’s first line of defence for mitigating the dissemination of illegal content is our Terms of Service, which states thatusers will not post “User Content” — anything that a user posts or otherwise make available on Pinterest — that infringes theintellectual property rights of others (e.g., copyright infringement, trademark infringement or counterfeit), or that is otherwiseunlawful. Consistent with those Terms, our Community Guidelines outline the types of content and behaviour prohibited fromthe Pinterest platform. There have been no changes to this part of our Terms of Service or our Community Guidelines sincethe 2023 risk assessment.

Similarly, our Advertising Guidelines outline the types of content prohibited in ads on Pinterest. Whilst these guidelines areglobal, they have been crafted to reflect certain types of content considered illegal for advertising in certain countries.

In addition to these external guidelines, Pinterest has detailed internal enforcement guidelines that delineate how to takeappropriate action on violating content on Pinterest, including removing, limiting distribution of and identifying permittedcontent. These policies and guidelines drive our overall content moderation approach, including how automated models areused, the types of content that users can report, our manual review process and our enforcement approach. See Pinterest’splatform ecosystem for more detail on these mechanisms.



Control Effectiveness Rating - Overall



In assessing the effectiveness of these controls we have taken into consideration the controls’ design and implementation andalso the enhancements made to our machine learning models (further information here). In addition, we’ve taken into accountvarious other factors, including the low number of reports for policy violations of categories of our Community Guidelinesthat most align to the concept of illegal content. For example, our most recent DSA Transparency Report (reporting period25th September 2023 to 31st December 2023) shows that we proactively removed over 16,000 Pins for violations of ourDangerous Goods \& Activities policy and removed 231 Pins as a result of user reports. Similar to last year, we have assessedour control effectiveness rating as Effective.

Pinterest Digital Services Act Risk Assessment and Mitigation Report 202421



How influencing factors affect this risk



In addition to considering the inherent risk rating and the controls we have in place, we considered how each of the influencingfactors could affect the systemic risk of the dissemination of illegal content.



Applicable terms and conditions and their enforcement



In drafting our policies and guidelines, we have worked to strike the balance between ensuring that our policies are global,easy to understand and being broad enough to cover a wide range of harmful content and behaviour. This allows our usersto easily understand what is and isn’t permitted on Pinterest, and it means that our policies are adaptable as new trends andtypes of harm emerge. While some policies such as our Advertising Guidelines, contain country-specific restrictions, weaddress country-specific definitions of illegal content on a case-by-case basis when government authorities, Pinners or otherthird parties report content that they believe may be illegal in their country.



Content moderation systems



Pinterest’s content moderation systems are driven by our policies and guidelines. We have multiple mechanisms in placeto detect and enforce our policies against policy-violating and illegal content. We use the latest modelling techniques andcontinually iterate on these models to make sure that we are keeping up with new and emerging types of harm. Our automatedmodels are used for specific types of policy violations and we continue to leverage this technology to further expand coverage.

In addition to our standard user reporting process, Pinners and non-Pinners in the EU can report content for suspectedillegality. Pinterest reviews these reports and removes globally or blocks access to content in the country or countries whereit is illegal.

A key element of our content moderation system is our human review process, which has an increasingly robust QA programmeto ensure that the decisions made by review agents are consistent, accurate and in line with our content moderation policies.



Design of recommender systems and any other relevant algorithmic systems



Pinterest’s recommender systems are designed to show our users content we think will be relevant, interesting, inspirationaland personal, based on explicit and implicit signals that we receive from users. If a user actively searches for illegal content,there is the possibility that our recommender systems will work to show more of this content to users.

We have several controls in place to prevent this from occurring, and our recommender systems serve as a key tool inpreventing the spread of this type of low-quality content. Our overall content moderation system seeks to identify andremove policy-violating and potentially illegal content from the platform, both proactively and in response to user and otherthird-party reports. Pinterest utilises a workflow which captures Pins, boards and users that have been deactivated due tocontent safety policy violations and excludes them from the data used by recommendation models to help prevent thesesystems from recommending similarly unsafe content.

In addition, our managed list of sensitive terms prevents a user’s search from returning any results for certain terms that weconsider likely to be policy-violating or otherwise harmful.

Even with these controls, there is still the possibility that illegal content could be recommended to users. This is particularlythe case if users search for content that in and of itself is not illegal, but they seek to use this content for inappropriateor illegal means.

Given the risk that illegal content can pose to users and EU society, we work hard to continuously improve our efforts toensure that our recommender systems don’t contribute to the dissemination of illegal content.

Pinterest Digital Services Act Risk Assessment and Mitigation Report 202422



Systems for selecting and presenting advertisements



Pinterest uses its Advertising Guidelines to let advertisers know what they can and cannot advertise on our Platform. Alladvertisers must agree to adhere to these guidelines as a condition of advertising on Pinterest. These guidelines containinformation on categories that may align to otherwise illegal content, including adult content, counterfeit goods, endangeredspecies and live animals, illegal drugs, and illegal products and services. As well as global requirements, the guidelines listcountry-specific guidance that prohibit certain types of ads from being targeted to certain regions.

Pinterest has multiple controls in place to enforce these guidelines, including automated models to detect prohibited contentand users reporting policy-violating ads. In addition, a portion of ads undergo a proactive review.



Data related practices



Similar to last year, we do not consider our data practices as specifically impacting the dissemination of illegal content.



Intentional manipulation



We don’t typically see spam attacks, fake accounts or ATOs specifically aimed at disseminating illegal content, however wehave controls in place to swiftly detect and act against this kind of intentional manipulation. We do not consider the risk ofintentional manipulation to specifically impact illegal content.

We’ve also considered the intentional manipulation of content through the use of GenAI or other manipulation efforts. Ourcontent policies and enforcement guidelines contain details on manipulated content and our content moderation tools aredesigned to identify and action harmful and policy-violating content regardless of how this content is created or manipulated.



Residual risk rating



Based on the inherent risk rating and the effectiveness of the controls we have in place, we have assessed the residual risk ofthe dissemination of illegal content posing harm to users and EU society as Low. There is no change to the residual risk ratingsince the 2023 risk assessment.



Further mitigation efforts



Though we have assessed this risk as Low, we are always working to enhance our controls because of the potential harm thatillegal content could cause to our users. We’re working on the following enhancements:



1. Agent Training Team: Pinterest plans to make additional investments in the area of agent training by increasingheadcount for our Agent Training team and further enhancing our current agent training programme.



2. Quality Assurance Team: Pinterest plans to make additional investments in our QA programme. We will be increasingheadcount in this programme and making further enhancements to our QA programme.



3. Risk Intelligence Team: Pinterest’s Risk Intelligence Engineering team plans to carry out enhanced monitoring of datasources, such as user reports across all policy areas to monitor and investigate significant fluctuations and identifyinternal gaps and emerging trends.

Pinterest Digital Services Act Risk Assessment and Mitigation Report 202423



5.2 Systemic Risk 2: Negative effects on the exercise of fundamental rightsSummary



Risk Overview



We have used the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU as our guide in assessing the risk that Pinterest could have actualor foreseeable negative effects on the exercise of fundamental rights.

Pinterest is primarily a visual platform and for that reason we have focused on the fundamental rights that are most relevant.These include, but are not limited to, freedom of expression and information, the right to non-discrimination, media freedomand pluralism, respect for private and family life, protection of personal data, human dignity, the rights of the child, the right toprotection of property including intellectual property, and consumer protection.

We have considered these fundamental rights individually, however, the risk ratings below reflect our assessment of the risks’impact on these fundamental rights in aggregate. In assessing these risks, we kept in mind the balance that must be struckbetween fundamental rights, other competing requirements of the DSA regarding content and user safety, and Pinterest’smission and responsibility to inspire and protect our users.



Inherent risk rating

Inherent Risk - Probability



Similar to last year, we have assessed the probability of the risk that the design, functioning or use of Pinterest negativelyimpacts the fundamental rights of users or EU society as Possible. We know from our detection mechanisms such as userreports, that it is possible for users to be exposed to content or behaviour on the Pinterest platform which might negativelyimpact the exercise of fundamental rights in the EU. The increased number of global elections was factored in when assessingthe probability of this risk, however, we found that though we increased the probability scores for the relevant risk areas, itdid not raise the probability score in aggregate. Fundamental rights are threaded throughout our Community Guidelines, likein our policy preventing hate speech on the platform. Our content moderation approach seeks to balance the fundamentalrights of users — for example, freedom of expression — with preventing harmful content and behaviour from appearing onthe platform.



Inherent Risk - Severity



Similar to last year, we have assessed the severity of the inherent risk that the design, functioning or use of Pinterestnegatively impacts the fundamental rights of users or EU society as Significant in the absence of controls. There has been nochange to the severity rating since last year’s risk assessment. Negative impacts to fundamental rights could lead to harm orconsequences for users and EU society. For example, it could lead to the violation of a user’s personal data or the suppressionof a user’s right to express themselves freely.

Overall inherent risk rating



Based on the probability and severity ratings, we have assessed the inherent risk that the design, functioning or use ofPinterest negatively impacts the fundamental rights of users or EU society as Medium. The overall inherent risk rating has notchanged since last year.



Controls and mitigation efforts



Our overall content moderation systems and controls work together to make Pinterest an inspirational and positive place onthe internet that also protects the fundamental rights of users and other members of EU society.



Freedom of expression and information



Pinterest users are free to express themselves and inspire others on our platform within the bounds of our CommunityGuidelines. Our Community Guidelines outline the type of behaviour we do and don’t allow on Pinterest and are alwaysgrounded in user safety. While some users may disagree with policy stances we have taken, for Pinterest, user safety is criticalto our business. Nevertheless, we have built nuance into our moderation systems to ensure that content can be reviewed withcontext and understanding, and users have the ability to appeal decisions if they disagree with our enforcement decisions.

Also, at times, we receive requests from EU government agencies to remove content on Pinterest that may be illegal in theircountry. The fundamental rights of our users are paramount — we diligently review these requests and we only take action oncontent that we have confirmed is policy-violating or illegal.



Non-discrimination



Pinterest is a place for inspiration, not discrimination. We have a number of policies that address discriminatory content andbehaviour on our platform. This includes our Hateful Activities policy, which prohibits hateful content and the people andgroups that promote hateful activities on Pinterest. Hateful activities include slurs and negative stereotypes, caricatures andgeneralisations, as well as support for hate groups and people promoting hateful activities.

In an effort to create belonging on Pinterest, we intentionally make the content surfaced on our platform more diverse andinclusive. Our Inclusive Product team oversees this effort and has put measures in place to make sure that fairness and biasare considered in our models and recommender systems. We also look at our models’ performance to see whether they arebehaving as intended. We want our systems to surface a diverse set of results — we don’t want our Pinners to work hard tofeel they are represented.

Our algorithms diversify our search results, related feeds and new user homefeeds by skin tone and body type, which directlyincreases representation. For Pinners who want to see more specific refinements, we’ve developed unprecedented, industry-leading inclusive features, such as hair pattern search, skin tone ranges and body type ranges. We want it to be easy for ourPinners to find content that’s relevant to them.

We also want Pinterest to be inclusive for all types of sight ability. We partnered with LightHouse for the Blind and VisuallyImpaired to better understand how we could make Pinterest more useful for people with different levels of vision. In 2018, wemade updates across our apps and website for Pinners with disabilities. For some surfaces, these updates included closedcaptioning, alternative text, better screen reader support and colour contrast sensitivity improvement. As a result, it’s mucheasier for users to browse, search and save ideas on Pinterest.



Media freedom and pluralism



We do not limit media or news organisations from joining, having accounts or creating Pins on Pinterest, except as requiredby law (for example, sanctioned state-controlled media organisations) and subject to our Terms of Service and CommunityGuidelines.

In addition, we know from research that Pinterest isn’t typically a platform where users come to seek news or currentaffairs. The top three categories that monthly users say they come to Pinterest for are Craft and DIY, Home Design and Decor,and Food and Drink.

Pinterest Digital Services Act Risk Assessment and Mitigation Report 202425



Protection of personal data



Pinterest highly values the protection of our users’ personal data. Pinterest’s Privacy Policy explains to users the personalinformation we collect, how we use it and the choices that users have related to this, which includes how we use data topersonalise a user’s experience on the platform and the information that we obtain on users from our partners and advertisers.We have Help Center articles that elaborate on our Privacy Policy. We have multiple options for users to choose how theirpersonal data is used. Detail on these options is provided in Pinterest’s platform ecosystem.

At times we receive legal requests from law enforcement for Pinterest user information. We diligently review each requestand only produce data for those that meet the requirements in our Law Enforcement guidelines and in accordance with ourPrivacy Policy and legal obligations.



Respect for private and family life



We give users options when it comes to engaging on the platform privately. Boards and Pins can be private, shared with alimited number of other accounts or visible to the public. The profiles of users under the age of 16 are set to private as thedefault and only option. Users can also report content for privacy violations, for example, if a Pin contains private contactinformation, personal or sensitive information, or is a private photo. Moreover, users can report and/or block other users ifthey believe they are being harassed.

A user can close their account at any time. When you close your account, we’ll deactivate it, remove your Pins and boardsfrom Pinterest, and delete your account data (subject to our standard data retention policies and legal requirements).



Human dignity



Our Community Guidelines outline the content and behaviour that is and isn’t allowed on Pinterest. We have specific policies,including our Harassment \& Criticism policy, to help people engage on Pinterest in a positive, inspirational and respectful way.We also prohibit content that insults, hurts or antagonises individuals or groups of people, including manipulated imagesintended to degrade or shame, shaming people for their bodies or assumed sexual or romantic history, sexual remarks aboutpeople’s bodies, solicitations or offers of sexual acts, and mocking someone for experiencing sadness, grief, loss or outrage.

Pinterest isn’t a place to insult, hurt or antagonise individuals or groups of people, and this type of behaviour is not tolerated.Respectful criticism is of course permitted, but we may limit the distribution of or remove insulting content that violates ourpolicies to keep Pinterest a positive, inspiring place on the internet.



Intellectual property



Pinterest respects intellectual property rights, and we expect our Pinners to do so as well. Our Copyright and Trademarkpolicies set out the ways that Pinterest protects the intellectual property and fundamental rights of our users. We respondpromptly to claims of copyright and trademark infringement on Pinterest. It’s our policy, in appropriate circumstances and atour discretion, to disable or terminate accounts that repeatedly or seriously infringe or are repeatedly charged with infringingcopyrights or other intellectual property rights.



Consumer protection



Although Pinterest is not involved in facilitating the purchase, sale or delivery of goods, we want people to have goodexperiences shopping for products they find on Pinterest. Merchants are responsible for making sure they follow all relevantlaws, regulations and industry codes when they use our service. Merchants are also responsible for handling and respondingto all purchases, deliveries, customer service questions, complaints, problems and disputes. These requirements are set outin our Merchant Guidelines.

Pinterest has a Verified Merchant programme to help shoppers discover and buy from verified brands. A verified merchantgets a badge on their profile and product Pins showing that their brand was verified by the Pinterest team. Verified merchantsmust adhere to specific requirements set out in our guidelines, and we also monitor shopping experience quality of verifiedmerchants. If we detect excessive user reports, merchants may be suspended from the programme. In addition to ourMerchant Guidelines, our Advertising Guidelines include information on unacceptable business practices.

Pinterest Digital Services Act Risk Assessment and Mitigation Report 202426



Control Effectiveness Rating - Overall



Similar to last year, and based on their design and implementation, we have assessed these controls as Effective. This ratingis based on a number of factors, including ongoing monitoring of the controls discussed above, the accuracy and coverageof our automated models, our controls designed to protect intellectual property, and ongoing monitoring of users’ reportsassociated with content of this nature. Our most recent DSA Transparency Report (reporting period 25th September - 31stAugust 2023) shows that we proactively removed over 20,000 Pins for violation of our Harassment \& Criticism policy and over16,000 Pins that violated our Hateful Activities policy. We’ve also made improvements to our product with the introductionof our body type ranges feature, demonstrating Pinterest’s commitment to creating belonging. However, given the potentialharm that this risk can pose to users and EU society, we work hard to continuously improve our efforts in these areas.



How influencing factors affect this risk



In addition to considering the inherent risk rating and the controls we have in place, we considered how each of the influencingfactors could broadly affect the exercise of fundamental rights. In the following analysis, we consider fundamental rightsas a whole.



Applicable terms and conditions and their enforcement



Our policies and guidelines provide transparency to users and allow them to decide whether Pinterest is a platform for them.By having clear policies and guidelines about the type of content and behaviour that is permitted on Pinterest, we are able tomoderate content in an unbiased way. Our policies are designed to balance the fundamental rights of users with protectingthe safety of our users. When we make updates to our policies and guidelines, we often engage external experts to ensurethat we are not disproportionately impacting a specific group of users.

Our policies and guidelines, and the enforcement of these, impact several of the fundamental rights discussed above,including freedom of expression and information, non-discrimination and human dignity.



Content moderation systems



Our overall content moderation approach works to detect and take appropriate action on harmful content that could impactfundamental rights, such as human dignity or non-discrimination. We have controls in place to ensure that these processesare accurate and without bias, including continually improving our detection measures, a QA programme for our humanreview processes, training for our review agents and an appeals process. Freedom of expression is taken into account andour Community Guidelines seek to balance the fundamental rights of users with preventing harm to our users.



Design of recommender systems and any other relevant algorithmic systems



Pinterest’s recommender systems are designed to show our users content we think will be relevant, interesting, inspirationaland personal. This impacts several of the fundamental rights discussed above including freedom of expression and informationand protection of personal data. We are transparent with users about how we use this information and users are giventhe option to “opt out” of personalised recommendations based on inferred signals, which limits the type of personal datathat we use.



Systems for selecting and presenting advertisements



Our Advertising Guidelines prohibit targeting audiences based on sensitive categories, such as race, religious beliefs orpolitical affiliations, among other things. Pinterest’s systems for presenting advertisements are designed to respect the rightto protect personal data, respect for private and family life, and non-discrimination.



Data related practices



Our Privacy Policy and internal data privacy and security policies work together to ensure that we collect, use and storepersonal data in an appropriate way and that we maintain the security of our users’ data. Details on these controls are providedin Pinterest’s platform ecosystem. These practices help to protect users’ fundamental rights, in particular regarding personaldata and respect for private and family life.

Pinterest Digital Services Act Risk Assessment and Mitigation Report 202427



Intentional manipulation



We don’t typically see spam attacks, fake accounts or ATOs specifically targeted towards the area of fundamental rights,however, we have controls in place to swiftly detect and act against intentional manipulation. We do not consider the risk ofintentional manipulation to specifically impact the exercise of fundamental rights.

As well as intentional manipulation through spam attacks or ATOs, we’ve also considered the intentional manipulation ofcontent through the use of GenAI or other manipulation efforts. Our content policies and enforcement guidelines containdetails on manipulated content and our content moderation tools are designed to identify and action harmful and policy-violating content regardless of how this content is created or manipulated.



Residual risk rating



Based on the inherent risk rating and the effectiveness of the controls we have in place, we have assessed the residual riskthat the design, functioning or use of Pinterest negatively impacts the fundamental rights of EU users or society as Low. Therehas been no change to the residual risk rating since last year.



Further Mitigation Efforts



Though we have assessed the residual risk as Low, we are always working to make improvements to this area. We’re workingon the following enhancements:



1. Body type diversity: We plan to improve the diversity of different men’s body types in men’s fashion search results.



2. User Reporting: Pinterest will be introducing a new user reporting function so that our community can reportsuspected underage users, which will help us in our efforts to keep our most vulnerable users safe and protected.

We’re also implementing additional controls around our use of GenAI and providing our users with information about how weuse GenAI. These enhancements will add to the ways we protect fundamental rights, particularly in relation to personal dataand respect for private and family life.

Additional investments in our Agent Training team will also enhance our detection and enforcement against content that maynegatively harm the fundamental rights of users. We are also making investments in our Quality Assurance Team to enhanceour current QA programme. As well as these measures, our Risk Intelligence Engineering Team will be carrying out enhancedmonitoring of data sources to identify policy grey areas and emerging trends across all content policies.

Pinterest Digital Services Act Risk Assessment and Mitigation Report 202428



5.3 Systemic Risk 3: Negative effects on civic discourse, electoral processes andpublic securitySummary



Risk Overview



When assessing the risk that Pinterest’s design, functioning or use could lead to negative effects on civic discourse, electoralprocesses and public security, we considered the various ways in which this risk could manifest, including misleadinginformation about election dates, how to correctly fill out a ballot, who is allowed to participate in an election or census,and fabricated or manipulated content (e.g., content generated with AI tools) creating the appearance of someone doingor saying something they didn’t with the clear intent of influencing public sentiment about a political figure and/or election.A change to the risk this year is the number of global elections that took place and/or are set to take place, including,amongst others, the European Parliament elections. We’ve set out below the additional measures we put in place to accountfor this change.

We also looked beyond elections to consider how users engage in civic discourse on the platform and whetherPinterest’s design has a negative effect upon this discourse. The assessment below reflects our analysis of these individualrisks in aggregate.



Inherent risk rating

Inherent Risk - Probability



Similar to last year, we have assessed the probability of the risk that the design, functioning or use of Pinterest negativelyimpacts civic discourse, electoral processes or public security in the EU as Possible. We know from our detection mechanismssuch as user reports and deactivations, that it is possible for users to be exposed to this type of content on Pinterest, however,generally, users do not come to Pinterest for election content and the number of users exposed to this type of content is low.

This is supported by data from our most recent DSA Transparency Report (reporting period 25th September to 31st December2023) showing that we removed a total of 137 Pins in the EU related to our Civic Participation Misinformation policy.



Inherent Risk - Severity



Similar to last year, we have assessed the severity of the inherent risk that the design, functioning or use of Pinterest inthe absence of controls negatively impacts civic discourse, electoral processes or public security in the EU as Significant,primarily because even limited exposure to content or behaviour of this nature for a small number of users could lead to harmor consequences.

Pinterest Digital Services Act Risk Assessment and Mitigation Report 202429

However, people do not come to Pinterest for political content, and as an image-based visual inspiration platform, thepossibility of rapid and widespread dissemination of content or “going viral” is low. This inherent severity risk rating of

Significant is based on the risk for EU society more broadly.

Our most recent Global Transparency Report (H2 2023) shows that in Q3 2023, we removed fewer distinct images andPins that violated our Civic Participation Misinformation policy compared with previous quarters. The decrease in Q3 2023compared with previous quarters was the result of fewer user reports for this policy and fewer matches of violative contentidentified. In Q4 2023, Pin and distinct image removals returned to the baseline from Q1 and Q2 2023.



Overall inherent risk rating



Based on the probability and severity ratings, we have assessed the inherent risk that the design, functioning or use ofPinterest negatively impacts civic discourse, electoral processes and public security in the EU as Medium. There has been nochange to this risk rating since last year.



Controls and mitigation efforts



As with other types of harmful content and behaviour, Pinterest’s first line of defence for mitigating negative effects on civicdiscourse, electoral processes and public security are our Community Guidelines and other relevant policies. Our CommunityGuidelines apply to all content categories and provide guardrails for appropriate civic participation on the Pinterest platform.We also have enforcement guidelines for our content review teams.

Our Civic Participation Misinformation policy prohibits misinformation, disinformation and mal-information, and the individualsor groups spreading or creating it on Pinterest. This policy prohibits false or misleading content on Pinterest that impedesan election’s integrity or an individual’s or group’s civic participation, including registering to vote, voting and being countedin a census.

Our Violent Actors policy also prohibits violent content, groups or individuals. We limit the distribution of or remove contentand accounts that encourage, praise, promote or provide aid to dangerous actors or groups and their activities. This includesextremists, terrorist organisations, gangs and other criminal organisations. We work with industry, government and securityexperts to help us identify these groups. For example, since 2019, Pinterest has been a member of the Global Internet Forumto Counter Terrorism (“GIFCT”), a non-governmental organisation designed to prevent terrorists and violent extremists fromexploiting digital platforms.

Our Conspiracy Theories policy prohibits conspiracy theories about civic participation and content that turns or encouragesturning individuals, groups of people, places or organisations into targets of harassment or physical violence, such as hate-based conspiracy theories and misinformation about mass atrocities.

Civic discourse is a broad concept and we have other policies that also work together to prevent negative effects. Thisincludes our Graphic Violence \& Threats policy, which covers threats against voting locations, census or voting personnel orparticipants and our Hateful Activities policy, which covers intimidation of vulnerable or protected group voters or participants.

These policies and guidelines drive our overall content moderation approach, including how automated models are used, thetypes of content that users can report, our manual review process and our enforcement approach.

Pinterest does not allow political campaign ads and this is outlined in our Advertising Guidelines. People come to Pinterestfor inspiration for recipes, fashion, home decor, crafting and do-it-yourself projects — people don’t come to Pinterest forpolitical content.

Although people don’t come to Pinterest for political content, we understand that we must be responsible when it comesto election integrity and civic engagement. We have elections-focused teams who proactively and reactively address majorelections around the world and decide what level of action is required based on the risk presented by each election. In order toidentify the risks associated with each election, we look at the number of users in each member state, any previous instancesof intentional information manipulation and any other known risks. The type of additional mitigation measures that will be putin place will be dependent on these risks.

Pinterest Digital Services Act Risk Assessment and Mitigation Report 202430

Our proactive measures include having our external third-party experts provide additional support including by runningtargeted reports on election activity, using these experts to notify us of harmful trends and to search for these trends onour platform. We also have internal specialists monitoring election-related narratives based on the work of our externalthird-party experts. The experts’ findings may lead to terms being added to the STL to limit or block the disseminationof harmful content on the platform. Our external partners also introduced dedicated election resources to support ourenforcement efforts.

In addition, during election periods in certain countries, when Pinners search on Pinterest for topics like “voting” or “elections,”we’ll show them a search advisory at the top of search results directing them to non-partisan authoritative voting resources.The purpose of these advisories is to help Pinners searching for election-related terms easily access authoritative resourcesthey can trust for more information about the elections happening in their country.



Control Effectiveness Rating - Overall



Similar to last year and based on the design and implementation of these controls, we have assessed these controls as

Effective. This rating is based on a number of factors, including the enhancements made to our machine learning modelsand the low number of users exposed to content that violates our Civic Participation Misinformation policy. Our most recentDSA Transparency Report (reporting period 25th September 2023 to 31st December 2023) shows that for violations of thispolicy, we proactively removed 132 Pins in the EU and removed five Pins as a result of user reporting. This rating is also basedon the ongoing monitoring of the accuracy and coverage of our automated models and ongoing monitoring of users reportsassociated with content of this nature.



How influencing factors affect this risk



In addition to considering the inherent risk rating and the controls we have in place, we considered how each of the influencingfactors could negatively affect civic discourse, electoral processes and public security.



Applicable terms and conditions and their enforcement



Civic discourse, electoral integrity and public security are broad concepts, and our policies and guidelines reflect this. Wehave multiple policies that work together to help prevent this risk from occurring on Pinterest. These policies and guidelinesare key to our enforcement of content that might negatively contribute to civic discourse, election integrity or public security,and they guide our overall content moderation approach.



Content moderation systems



Given the complexity of this risk area, Pinterest partners with external third-party experts to provide us with further supporton risk areas like misinformation, election integrity and political issues specific to particular geographies. These experts helpus better understand how these risks can manifest on Pinterest and they provide us with signals (like trending keywords)that we build into our overall content moderation system, including our managed list of sensitive terms. Our overall contentmoderation system also works to prevent the risk that Pinterest causes a negative effect on civic discourse, electoral integrityor public security. We have multiple mechanisms in place to detect and enforce violating content, such as user reports andmanual reviews. See Pinterest’s content moderation ecosystem for more detail on these mechanisms.



Design of recommender systems and any other relevant algorithmic systems



Our systems recommend content primarily based on a user’s previous activity and we know that users do not primarily cometo Pinterest to participate in civic discourse or find information about elections. As such, the design of our recommendersystems and the nature of our platform’s purpose do not have a significant negative effect on political discourse or civicengagement.

Pinterest Digital Services Act Risk Assessment and Mitigation Report 202431



Systems for selecting and presenting advertisements



Pinterest’s advertising system is designed to help decrease the risk that Pinterest could negatively impact civic discourse,electoral integrity or public security. Our Advertising Guidelines prohibit political campaign advertisements. We do notallow advertising for the election or defeat of political candidates running for public office, including fundraising for politicalcandidates or parties, political parties or action committees, political issues with the intent to influence an election, legislation(including referenda or ballot initiatives), and merchandise related to political candidates, parties or elections. We also do notallow advertisers to target certain audiences, including based on political affiliation. Pinterest has multiple controls in place toenforce these guidelines, including manual review of ads, automated models to detect prohibited content and users reportingpolicy-violating ads.



Data related practices



We do not consider our data practices to specifically impact civic discourse, electoral integrity or public security.



Intentional manipulation



We’ve also looked at how intentional manipulation can affect the area of civic discourse, electoral processes and publicsecurity. Similar to the area of fundamental rights, we typically don’t see spam attacks, fake accounts or ATOs targetedtowards this area of risk, however, our controls work to detect and act against intentional manipulation when it occurs.

An additional factor that we have considered for this year’s risk assessment is the area of the intentional manipulation ofcontent itself through the use of GenAI or other manipulation efforts to produce fabricated, manipulated or edited content,such as deepfakes and shallowfakes. Our Community Guidelines, including our Civic Participation Misinformation policy, aswell as our internal enforcement guidelines contain details on our approach and efforts to action any policy-violating content.Our content moderation tools are equipped to identify and action this type of harmful content when it appears on the platformregardless of how the harmful content is created.



Residual risk rating



Based on the inherent risk rating and the effectiveness of the controls we have in place, we have assessed the residual riskthat Pinterest’s design, functioning or use could lead to negative effects on civic discourse, electoral processes or publicsecurity in the EU as Low. This rating is the same as last year. Though there has been increased political action in the EU dueto the number of elections scheduled for 2024, we’re satisfied that the additional measures we implemented in response tothis plus our belief that people do not come to Pinterest for political content keeps the residual risk rating for this risk at Low.



Further mitigation efforts



Because of the potential harm that this risk can pose to users and EU society, we work hard to continuously enhance ourpolicies and processes. Though people don’t come to Pinterest for political content, we understand our responsibilities whenit comes to civic engagement and we are making the following enhancements: We are making additional investments inour Agent Training team, which will enhance our detection and enforcement against content that could result in negativeeffects on civic discourse, electoral processes and public security. In addition, we are also making investments in our QualityAssurance Team to further enhance our current QA programme. Also, our Risk Intelligence Engineering team will be carryingout enhanced monitoring of data sources to identify policy grey areas and emerging trends across all content policy areas.

Pinterest Digital Services Act Risk Assessment and Mitigation Report 202432



5.4 Systemic Risk 4: Negative effects in relation to gender-based violence,the protection of public health and minors, and serious negativeconsequences to the person’s physical and mental well-beingSummary



Risk Overview



In looking at the ways that these risks could manifest on our platform, we have looked at the volume of harmful contentrelated to these risks, such as health misinformation, content promoting physical or mental harm, hate speech, harassment,or child sexual exploitation (“CSE”) content.

We also considered Pinterest’s design and whether this contributes to these risks — for example, are there adequatesafeguards for minors, does the platform tap into users’ addictive behaviours, and do we provide users with options for howthey engage on the platform.

The assessment below reflects our analysis of these individual risks in aggregate.



Inherent risk rating

Inherent Risk - Probability



Similar to last year, we have assessed the probability of the risk that Pinterest’s design, functioning or use negatively impactsthe protection of public health and minors, a person’s physical and mental well-being, or gender-based violence in the EU as

Possible.

We know from our detection mechanisms such as user reports, that it is possible for users to be exposed to this type ofcontent on Pinterest, however, data indicates that the number of users exposed to this type of content is low. Our most recentDSA Transparency Report (reporting period 25th September 2023 to 31st December 2023) shows that we received 32 userreports that resulted in Pins being removed for violating our Medical Misinformation policy, 595 user reports that resulted inPins being removed for violating our Self-Injury \& Harmful Behaviour policy, and 1,233 user reports that resulted in Pins beingremoved for violating our Child Safety policy.



Inherent Risk - Severity



Similar to last year, we have assessed the severity of this inherent risk if left unchecked as Significant, primarily because evenlimited exposure to content or behaviour of this nature for a small number of users could lead to harm or consequences.

Pinterest Digital Services Act Risk Assessment and Mitigation Report 202433

However, rapid dissemination or content “going viral” is not common on Pinterest and this is critical to understanding theseverity of this risk more broadly. We have looked at the concept of “reach” to understand this. If we take data from our mostrecent Global Transparency (H2 2023) report we can see that of the Pins removed for violating our Health Misinformationpolicy in Q4 of 2023, 95% were seen by fewer than 10 users during that reporting period. Also, looking at our Self-Injuryand Harmful Behaviour policy, of the Pins removed in Q4 of 2023 for violation of this policy, 95% were seen by fewer than 10people.



Overall inherent risk rating



Similar to last year, based on the probability and severity ratings, we have assessed the inherent risk that the design, functioningor use of Pinterest negatively impacts the protection of public health and minors, a person’s physical and mental well-being,or gender-based violence in the EU as Medium.



Controls and mitigation efforts



Our content moderation system is one of the main ways that we mitigate this risk. Our systems are capable of quickly detectingand removing harmful content. The other main way that we mitigate this risk is through the design of our platform. It is difficultto amplify risks to public health, minors, physical and mental health, and gender-based violence in a “viral” manner. Pinterest’sRecommender Systems are designed to prioritise high-quality and inspirational content — we have specific search featuressuch as compassionate search, to guide users to well-being practices if they are trying to manage difficult emotions, and oursearch advisories give our users direct access to suicide prevention lifelines.

We’ve continued our work in this area to help make Pinterest a safer place for our users, focusing on public health, safety andhealth of minors, and the physical and mental well-being of all of our users. Further details on the steps we’ve taken in thisarea can be found here.

Our Community Guidelines are the foundation upon which our content moderation systems are built — they outline what weallow on Pinterest and the type of content that we prohibit on our platform. In addition to our Community Guidelines, we haveseveral enforcement guidelines that provide additional guidance and clarification to our content review teams and systems.Specifically pertaining to this risk we have our Child Safety policy, Dangerous Goods \& Activities policy, Graphic Violence \&Threats policy, Adult Sexual Services policy, Harassment \& Criticism policy, Hateful Activities policy, Medical Misinformationpolicy, and Self-Injury \& Harmful Behaviour policy. These policies and guidelines drive our overall content moderationapproach, including how automated models are used, the types of content that users can report, our manual review processand our enforcement approach.

Pinterest has a longstanding commitment to creating a safe and positive place online, particularly for more vulnerable users,such as minors. We are committed to continuously designing and implementing measures that allow us to keep our youngusers safe and investing in our policies, products and partnerships to support the well-being of our community. We makechanges in response to new behaviours and trends we’ve observed online, adopt technology available to combat harmfulcontent, enhance brand safety for our advertising partners, and also simply because it’s the right thing to do for the peopleon our platform.

Given the potential severity and harm associated with these risks, Pinterest has the following controls in place to protect ourmost vulnerable users:

• We do not allow users under the minimum age of consent in their country to sign up for Pinterest. Where and whenwe discover any accounts of an underage user, we deactivate them.

• Private only: The profiles of users under the age of 16 are set to private as the default and only option, and in theEU, the accounts of users aged 16 and 17 are set to private by default with the option to switch to a public account.Private profiles are undiscoverable on Pinterest search and search engines, and profiles, boards and Pins for userswith private profiles are only visible to followers approved by the user. Users with private profiles are able to connectwith family and friends by sending a unique profile link, and all users have the ability to review and remove followers.

• Removal of existing followers: For teens under the age of 16, all existing followers were removed in August 2023, sothat those users could start with a clean slate to decide who can follow them.

Pinterest Digital Services Act Risk Assessment and Mitigation Report 202434

• No contact without consent: Teens under the age of 16 can only send and receive messages from mutual followerswho have been accepted through a unique profile link that expires after three days or when they connect with fivenew followers using this unique link, whichever comes first. Teens who are 16 and 17 can only receive messages frommutual followers, and can only receive message requests from users they follow.

• User reporting: The reporting reasons in Pinterest’s in-product content reporting tool were updated to include not onlysexually explicit content, but also any content that sexualises minors. We have also enabled more nuanced reasonsto report users and boards. Though users could always report content or accounts, the community is now able to flaga more detailed and nuanced list of behaviours at both the user and board level. This includes: impersonation, savingnormally appropriate content in a potentially sexualised manner, among many others.

• Help Center resources: The Pinterest Help Center provides information to parents or caregivers of teens on Pinterest.It explains our minimum age requirements, provides privacy resources and specifies ways for parents to notify us ifthey suspect their underage child has a Pinterest account so it can be deleted.

• Age change verification: If a user who previously entered their age as under 18 attempts to edit their date of birth onthe Pinterest app, Pinterest requires them to submit a government ID and/or selfie to a third-party partner to confirmtheir age.

• Parental support: Pinterest offers a parental passcode feature for users under the age of 18, which allows parents andcaregivers to set up a 4-digit passcode to lock certain settings and have oversight of their teen’s Pinterest account.These settings include those related to account management, privacy and data, public/private profile status, andsocial permissions, such as messaging, mentions, comments and shopping recommendations.

We know, however, that this work is never done, so we continuously re-evaluate the effectiveness of our safety features andhow they fit into our broader goal of creating a positive, inspirational product experience. Part of that process is listening tofeedback from our users, and accordingly, in partnership with an external third party, we held a workshop with teen users tosee what they thought of teen safety features. While, of course, individual users’ opinions differ, several trends are discernableamong younger users concerning both online safety in general as well as the specific measures recently implemented byPinterest.

Teen users tell us that they are interested in finding more positive content online, and rather than using Pinterest to communicate,they use it to tap into creativity and commemorate important moments in their lives. When it comes to online safety, teenstell us that they are interested in having the ability to create their own online experiences by having control over their actionsand interactions. This includes maintaining privacy over their online activity so they can feel free to express their aspirationsand explore their identities. While some teen users recognise the value of age verification to protect their online experience,limitations on their online access can make them feel isolated and undervalued. Accordingly, they express a preference forfeatures that empower them to show up as good digital citizens.

We’re not just concerned with the safety of the teens that use our platform — we also want to support their mental healthand emotional well-being and the mental health and emotional well-being of all our users. We’ve designed our product tohelp further this mission. For example, we have no filters on beauty. Beauty filters that alter a person’s appearance whenposting online can change the way teens think about themselves. We’ve taken a stand and don’t have those kinds of filters onPinterest. Our virtual Try On tool is a compelling way to play with eye makeup and lipstick colours, but it won’t alter the user’sface because we believe they look great just the way they are.

To further our efforts supporting mental health and inspiring our users, we have created specific search features. Pinterest’scompassionate search feature includes a collection of evidence-based well-being practices that someone can do to improvetheir mood if they are feeling anxious, sad or trying to manage difficult emotions. For example, if someone searches for “stressrelief,” they might choose the “redirect your energy” activity, which suggests practices like journaling for perspective, drawinga nature scene or making a playlist. If they select “accept your emotions,” they’ll be guided through steps to practise self-compassion. For people who may be experiencing thoughts of suicide or need someone to talk to immediately, we continueto provide search advisories with direct access to suicide prevention lifelines.

Control Effectiveness Rating - Overall



Similar to last year, and based on their design and implementation, we have assessed these controls as Effective. This ratingis based on a number of factors, including the enhancements made to our machine learning models, the ongoing monitoringaccuracy and the data in our most recent DSA Transparency Report (reporting period 25th September 2023 to 31st December2023). For example, we removed over 8,000 Pins for violation of our Health Misinformation policy and over 1,000,000 Pins forviolation of our Self-Injury \& Harmful Behaviour Policy, while we removed just over 500 Pins due to user reports for violationsof both this policy.



How influencing factors affect this risk



Similar to the other systemic risks, we’ve considered how each of the influencing factors affects risks to public health, minors,physical and mental health, and gender-based violence.



Applicable terms and conditions and their enforcement



Per our Terms of Service, if you’re based in the European Economic Area, you may only use Pinterest if you are over the age atwhich you can provide consent to data processing under the laws of your country, and we require a date of birth for new andexisting accounts for all users regardless of age. We have recently expanded our age verification process. If someone whopreviously entered their age as under 18 attempts to edit their date of birth on the Pinterest app, we will require them to sendadditional information to our third-party age verification partner to confirm its legitimacy.

We have specific policies and guidelines that address public health and the mental and physical health of our users, includingminors. These policies drive our content moderation and enforcement approach.



Content moderation systems



Our overall content moderation system works together to detect and enforce content which might negatively impact publichealth, minors, physical and mental health, and gender-based violence. Given the severity of this risk, we invested in researchto understand how these risks could manifest on the platform and have built specialised controls and product features as aresult. We have also made further investments in our Minor Safety Operations team, creating a dedicated team for this area.The members of this team are minor safety specialists who perform operational and investigatory review of content andbehaviour that potentially violates Pinterest’s Child Safety policy identified via reactive and proactive detection. We have alsomade additional investments with external third-party experts who monitor child safety trends on our platform.



Design of recommender systems and any other relevant algorithmic systems



We have made deliberate choices to engineer a more positive place online and prevent our platform from negatively impactingmental health. In order to make sure that the Pinterest platform itself is additive, not addictive, we tune our algorithmic systemsto prioritise explicit signals — for example, “saves” — over just views alone. When people see something on Pinterest that theywant to act on, they hit “save.” By prioritising what gets “saved” in the content, the images and videos that are top performingdon’t distract users from their life (like car crash videos or conspiracy theories), but actually help users improve it (like step-by-step guides, self-care ideas, inspirational quotes and how-to videos). Building our algorithmic systems to prioritise high qualityand inspirational content enables us to create a more positive environment that can support the mental health of our users.



Systems for selecting and presenting advertisements



We do not want ads on our platform that might create a negative impact for our users. To protect the physical and mentalhealth of our users, including minors, our Advertising Guidelines place restrictions on certain categories of advertisements,including drugs and paraphernalia, sensitive content (such as excessively violent or profane content), tobacco, alcohol,gambling products and services, and body shaming language and imagery.

In addition to these restrictions, we limit how ads can be targeted to certain audiences. Ads cannot be targeted based onsensitive health or medical conditions, among other things. In addition, ads cannot be targeted or served to minors based onprofiling and currently are not being served to minors in the EU at all.

Our guidelines are restrictive to ensure that Pinner safety comes first and we have controls in place to enforce these guidelines,detailed in Pinterest’s platform ecosystem.

Data related practices



Users may only use Pinterest if they are over the age at which they can provide consent to data processing under the laws oftheir country. If a user is the appropriate age to create a Pinterest account, their data is collected and used per the practicesset out in Pinterest’s platform ecoystem.



Intentional Manipulation



Similar to the other systemic risks, we’ve looked at how intentional manipulation can affect gender-based violence, theprotection of public health and minors, and serious negative consequences to the person’s physical and mental well-being.We typically don’t see spam attacks, fake accounts or ATO’s targeted towards this area of risk, however, our controls work todetect and act against this type of intentional manipulation when it does occur.

We also looked at how intentional manipulation of content itself, either through the use of GenAI or other manipulation effortsto produce manipulated or edited content impacts on this area of risk. Our content moderation tools do not distinguishbetween harmful content that is manipulated or edited and harmful content that has not been manipulated. Our contentmoderation tools work to identify and action all policy-violating and harmful content regardless of how it was created.



Residual risk rating



Based on the inherent risk rating and the effectiveness of the controls we have in place, we have assessed the residual riskthat Pinterest could negatively impact the protection of public health and minors, a person’s physical and mental well-being,or gender-based violence in the EU as Low. There has been no change to the overall risk level since last year’s risk assessment.



Further mitigation efforts



Though we have assessed this risk as Low, the safety of our users is top of mind and we are always looking for ways toenhance our controls. We’re working on the following enhancements in this area:



1. Search Advisory: We are partnering with a new external expert to improve our search advisory resources for peoplewho may need someone to talk to immediately. This new partnership will allow us to make sure our resources remainhigh quality and will also allow for different contact formats for our users.



2. Parental Support: We’ve recently made changes to strengthen our parental support measures, including taking stepsto verify the details of parents or caregivers looking to make adjustments to account management, privacy, profilestatus and social permission settings.

We are also planning for further improvements in this area, by making additional investments in our Agent Training team forour agents who carry out manual review. In addition, we will make additional investments in our Quality Assurance team tofurther enhance our current QA programme. Our plans to introduce a new user reporting function for our users to reportsuspected underage users will enhance the measures we already have in place for minor safety. As well as these measures,our Risk Intelligence Engineering team will be carrying out enhanced monitoring of data sources to identify policy grey areasand emerging trends across all content policy areas.

6\. Conclusion



Our second annual DSA Risk Assessment and Mitigation Report builds on our previous analysis of the systemic risks thatstem from the design, functioning or use of Pinterest and its systems, and highlights the areas where we can further mitigatethose risks to protect our users. We want Pinterest to be a safer place online for all of our users. We will continue to investin our content moderation systems and explore new ways and invest in technology to fight policy-violating content on ourplatform. We are always evolving to identify and adapt to new behaviours and trends, and we’ll continue to work hard to fulfilour mission to bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they love.

Appendix

Risk assessment methodology



To determine the risk that the design or functionality of Pinterest could cause harm to users and EU society, we first developeda risk register. This register was developed in consultation with a wide group of stakeholders and utilised Pinterest’s existingunderstanding of how harm can manifest on the platform as well as focusing on the systemic risks identified by the DSA.We assessed each risk individually and then reported on these risks at an aggregated level. To assess each risk we used thefollowing formula:



Inherent risk rating x control effectiveness score = residual risk rating



Inherent risk rating



We considered:

• Severity: the impact that it would have on user groups and EU society in general; and

• Probability: the likelihood of this impact occurring.

Each element was giving a score using a four-point scale and the inherent risk rating was obtained using the following formula:



Severity score x Probability score = Inherent risk rating

Control effectiveness



We identified the controls and safeguards in place to mitigate each risk and determined how effective the control environmentis in mitigating the inherent systemic risk. We considered the design of the control and, where available, we looked at metricsand data to understand the effectiveness of the control. We did not perform control testing as part of the DSA risk assessment,although we plan to implement control testing as part of future DSA risk assessments.



Control effectiveness rubric



Rating Definition Score



Highly effective Control designed and implemented to reduce the risk almost entirely 0.25

Effective Control designed and implemented to reduce most aspects of the risk 0.50

Somewhate effective Control designed and implemented to reduce some aspects of the risk 0.75

Ineffective Control has a very limited impact on reducing the risk 1.0



Residual risk rating



The resulting cumulative systemic risk exposure was determined by multiplying the inherent systemic risk score against thecontrol effectiveness score to determine the residual risk rating.
