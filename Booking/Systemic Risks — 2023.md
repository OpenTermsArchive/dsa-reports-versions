Assessment conducted by Booking.com B.V. under

Introduction



At Booking.com, our mission is to make it easier for everyone to experience the world. We

believe that travel can bring out the best in humanity. Travel promotes a better understanding

of different cultures and ways of life. We also believe in and work towards making travel a

force for good in the world - one that enriches people’s lives through a range of experiences,

big and small. As a travel platform, it is at the core of our activities to facilitate travel

experiences centred on our customers and underpinned by our values.



Our long-held values as well as our guidelines and terms and conditions for all users of our

platform - travellers and supply partners - are designed to foster safe and welcoming travel

experiences for all.



❖ Travel Respectfully (Act with Integrity) \- We expect our employees, customers and

partners to treat each other with respect. We do not tolerate any form of harassment,

discrimination, hate speech, manipulation, physical violence or any other threatening or

abusive behaviour. Additionally, we expect our supply partners and travellers to

conduct business on our platform in an honest and professional manner, to not

misrepresent themselves and to respect agreements that are made with each other.



❖ Travel Safely \- The safety (physical and otherwise) of our travellers, supply partners

and employees is our priority. Users of our platform may not engage in or promote any

activities that bring harm to any person.



❖ Travel Confidently \- We are committed to providing the best user experience for

everybody who uses our travel services. That means that we take user privacy seriously

and are committed to protecting and safeguarding user privacy in accordance with our

Privacy and Cookie Statement and applicable laws. We are dedicated to ensuring that

our online environment is trusted and secure. We exercise vigilance to ensure that we

iterate our processes and controls to address emerging challenges and risks and do so

in real time. Keeping data provided on our platform safe and secure is important to us.

Booking.com therefore protects users’ personal data and credit card information in line

with applicable laws, including the GDPR and the data security standards of the

Payment Card Industry (PCI DSS).



1

At Booking.com, we believe that the importance of the travel industry as a powerful global

economic driver cannot be viewed separately from our responsibility to ensure there is a world

worth experiencing for future generations. Sustainability is not only intertwined with the

long-term viability of our industry, it is foundational to our business. Our environmental, social,

and governance (ESG) initiatives, processes and principles demonstrate our continued

emphasis on being a sustainable and ethical global business.



We are committed to respecting and promoting human rights wherever we do business. As

one of the world’s leading online travel companies, we respect the human rights of our

stakeholders by seeking to avoid infringing on the rights of others and working to address

adverse human rights impacts of the travel sector. Our commitment to respect and promote

human rights, as reflected in our Human Rights Statement, is based on internationally

recognized standards and principles, including the United Nations (UN) Guiding Principles on

Business and Human Rights.



At Booking.com we measure success not only by the value that we create for our company but

by the positive impact we create for all - our employees, customers, partners, communities,

other stakeholders, stockholders and governments.



We now present the findings of our risk assessment as required by the EU’s Digital Services

Act (DSA).

Section 1 - Report on DSA Risk Assessment



The DSA requires that “very large online platforms” (VLOPs) conduct annual risk assessments

to determine if and how their services (or the use of their services) may pose systemic risks to

EU citizens. The Booking.com online platform (“Booking.com” or the “platform”) has received a

VLOP designation, and this report sets out the results of our assessment.



Our assessment was conducted over a five-month period with a range of stakeholder groups

and in collaboration with advisors and consultants, including a global non-profit sustainable

business network and consultancy. Together, we leveraged diversity of thought and expertise

to assess the range of risk categories outlined in the DSA as well as the experiences and

realities of our business environment. Our process included convening focus group discussions

with key stakeholders across our organisation (including: Engineering, Compliance \& Ethics,

Data Privacy \& Security, Legal \& Public Affairs, Trust \& Safety and others).



This assessment - though responsive to the specific requirements of the DSA - is not our first

foray into understanding the ways in which our business interacts with or impacts the world

around us. In fact, it builds on a body of work and a culture of responsibility and safety that has

long been part of Booking.com. Our expectations for ourselves and our partners are published

in a number of public-facing resources. Our commitment to respecting and promoting human

rights wherever we do business is reflected in our Human Rights Statement - the result of a

thorough assessment (supported by business and human rights experts) of human rights risks

throughout our ecosystem. We have also outlined steps we are taking with respect to the risk

of human trafficking and modern slavery in our Modern Slavery Statement. Our commitments

to ethics, ESG and sustainability, privacy, fair competition, and other core values can be found in

our Code of Conduct, Supplier Code of Conduct, Climate Action Plan and our Sustainability

Report - inviting all who do business with us to share our commitment to absolute integrity

and adhere to the highest ethical standards, applicable laws, and our own requirements for

fostering safe and inclusive travel experiences.



This risk assessment report has been prepared under the supervision of the Booking.com B.V.

Head of DSA Compliance, and has been reviewed and approved by the company’s

Management Body. The nature of the assessment (and most of the risks) addressed by the

DSA is not dissimilar from that which we have, over time, been conscious of and have been

addressing prior to the introduction of the DSA.



3

Our assessment shows that the design and functioning of Booking.com does not pose

significant systemic risks to EU citizens because of the nature of our service and our history

of continuously assessing and mitigating risks to society. That is largely because:



1. We are a transaction-focused platform and not a user-generated content-focused

platform. Our platform connects travellers (those who make travel reservations via our

platform) with memorable destinations and trips. Our travellers do not use Booking.com

to access news, share strong opinions or influence the behaviour of others (outside of

their travel experiences), or post high-risk or harmful user-generated content. As such,

the likelihood of illegal content appearing on our platform is limited and the

possibility of such content (were it to occur) spreading “rapidly and widely through

accounts with a particularly wide reach or other means of amplification” is even

more limited (see, Recital 80 of the DSA).



2. We only allow partners that offer travel services on our platform (“supply partners”)

and travellers (together, “users”) to upload a limited range of content, and such

content is confined to specific areas of the service (like guest reviews for

accommodation properties). We do not provide a personalised user-specific homepage

with user-generated content or news feed where people continuously post broad

ranges of content types. Where travellers or supply partners do upload their own

content (e.g., property reviews or content related to the property listings), it must

comply with our policies and content moderation processes, which prohibit abusive,

discriminatory or otherwise harmful content. As such, our platform is unlikely to be

used (or even usable) in ways that contribute to “negative effects on democratic

processes, civic discourse and electoral processes, as well as public security” (see,

Recital 82 of the DSA).



3. Our travellers spend their time on Booking.com in a focused and targeted way: to

search and seamlessly book travel experiences. Our services are not designed to be

“binged” and do not organically carry that kind of allure. The nature of our service (as

described above) materially limits the possibility of the platform being used for

“coordinated disinformation campaigns related to public health, or [in ways that]

stimulate behavioural addictions of recipients of the service” (see, Recital 83 of the

DSA).



4. Our platform is generally not for use by or of a nature that attracts minors. Our

terms and conditions limit the use of our platform to those over the age of 16, and the



4

type of content on our platform is not generally associated with minors or direct harm

to minors.



5. Where other risks to society may occur (e.g., cyber fraud, phishing, etc.), they stem

largely from abuse or inauthentic use of the service (as opposed to the nature and

design of the service) that is not in line with our published terms and conditions. On

the basis of our assessment, we believe that our platform and services pose only low

risks to society - with the majority of risks assessed presenting only moderate potential

impact on individuals. Our internal processes and controls are generally effective at

addressing these risks, and the impacts (should such risks materialise) are generally

remediable.



As noted above and with reference to our values, human rights commitments, and Codes of

Conduct, we are constantly working to enhance the experience and safety of our travellers and

supply partners. The results of this risk assessment have informed some of our ongoing efforts

to ensure the safety and integrity of our platform. Importantly, where necessary, we have

adopted or are in the process of adopting further measures, in addition to the many existing

safety features and functions we operate, to further mitigate the risks identified.



Section 2 - Methodology



The DSA requires that we assess the impact of Booking.com in four key risk areas:



1. illegal content;

2. the exercise of fundamental rights;

3. civic discourse, electoral processes, public security; and

4. gender-based violence, physical and mental well-being.



We employed a human rights based approach to conduct the systemic risk assessment,

grounded in the widely accepted methodology of human rights due diligence under the UN

Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which offers an authoritative and trusted

methodological framework and thus enabled us to:



1. achieve compliance with both the spirit of and letter of the DSA;

2. achieve a higher quality assessment through the use of a tested and proven

methodology; and

3. draw from Booking.com’s broader human rights due diligence activities and experience.



5

We conducted our assessment taking the following steps:



First, we took into account the severity of these risks by reference to three key factors:



1. Scope: this refers to the number of our users (or other people) who could be affected by

the risk.

2. Scale: this refers to the gravity and significance of the impact as experienced by any

individual affected person.

3. Remediability: this refers to any limits on the ability to put those affected back in the

situation they were in before the impact.



Second, we assessed the probability of each risk materialising (more likely than not), i.e., with

respect to any population of people or to a specific individual. For example, the risk that

discriminatory content could be visible to any user or a specific individual towards whom the

comment or content may be targeted.



Last, we determined a combined risk weighting taking into account the severity of each risk and

the probability of occurrence. Importantly, our methodology gives severity three times the

weight of probability in our assessment of the risk. This is aligned with international human

rights standards and approaches and ensures that even if the probability of a risk materialising

is low, the risk may nonetheless be given more weight depending on the severity of the impact

on the affected individuals.



We assessed the risks that Booking.com may pose to EU citizens by analysing a number of risk

scenarios designed to give us broad and comprehensive coverage of the areas required by the

DSA. We applied our methodology to each risk statement, and have grouped the results into

three tiers in descending order of significance - with significance being a combination of

severity (the scope of how many people may be affected, the seriousness of any impact and

the degree of remediability), and probability (likelihood of the risk materialising). In assessing

the severity and probability of the systemic risks identified, we took into account the risk factors

listed in Article 34.2 of the DSA, considering their relevance and to what extent they increased

and/or reduced the risk. As noted above, we have weighed the severity of impact three times

more than probability. As such, the tiering below is primarily driven by the severity (and of that,

remediability in particular) of a potential adverse impact and not just by the likelihood or

probability (or lack thereof) that the adverse impact will materialise.



6

Tier 1 consists of risks where we assess the nature of an adverse impact as high (factoring

severity, scope and probability); with high impacts being those where it is either not possible or

particularly challenging to fully remediate the impact.



Tier 2 consists of risks where we assess the nature of an adverse impact as moderate -

(factoring severity, scope and probability); with moderate impacts being those where the

impact can be remediated to a significant degree with only minimal residual impact.



Tier 3 consists of risks where we assess the nature of an adverse impact (factoring severity,

scope and probability) as low; with low impacts being those where the impact can be fully

remediated with no measurable residual impact.



Further, we considered how the risk and safety mitigation systems and processes we already

have put in place (developed and honed over more than 25 years running our platform) might

impact the potential risks identified. We also took into consideration any impact that these

mitigation measures would have on other fundamental rights (e.g., the potential impact of a

mitigation measure on freedom of speech or expression).



Section 3 - “Results”



The results of our assessment (reflected in Figures 1 and 2 below) indicate that the design and

functioning of Booking.com does not pose significant risks to EU citizens. Importantly, when

viewed in the light of other types of platforms that have received VLOP designations from the

European Commission, we consider that Booking.com falls well on the low end of the risk

spectrum.



Nonetheless, ours is a culture of learning and continuous improvement. We routinely use

information and experience gleaned from all aspects of our business and our interactions with

our stakeholders to build on and improve our products and services. The same is true here. Our

DSA risk assessment will inform our DSA compliance journey as well as the steps we will take

to further mitigate the risks discussed below. We will report on mitigation measures as

required by the DSA in due course.

Tier 1



Fundamental rights



Risk that users may engage in discriminatory behaviour towards other users on the

platform (non-discrimination)



Travellers of the Booking.com platform have only limited interactions with supply partners and

ordinarily no direct interaction with other travellers on the platform. Communication or

interaction channels are focused on facilitating the travel experience or to conclude a

reservation. Booking.com does not have communications channels of the type generally

associated with social media and that are conducive to sharing views or opinions that are

unrelated to the narrow topic of travel experiences. For instance, we do not provide a

personalised user-specific homepage with user-generated content or news feed where people

continuously post broad ranges of content types.



As such, risks in this area could emanate in only a limited number of ways:



● In our partner-to-guest messaging utility (which allows, for example, a hotel to send

messages to a traveller ahead of or during their stay). By having access to demographic

details (or information that could be indicative of demographic data such as name or

nationality) of a traveller, a supply partner could, potentially, engage in a discriminatory

exchange with that traveller (and vice versa) through the partner-to-guest utility.



● In our guest reviews utility. Travellers are able to leave reviews of their travel

experiences on our platform and could potentially use inappropriate or discriminatory

language in describing people or places.



● In interactions between our employees and our users. Travellers and supply partners

may interact with our customer service representatives in addressing their various

travel-related needs. It is possible that users engage in potentially discriminatory

exchanges with our colleagues or vice versa.



Such exchanges and interactions would be in violation of our terms and conditions and, where

applicable, our Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct.



9

Booking.com does not tolerate any form of discrimination - within our company or on our

platform. Our Content Standards and Guidelines set out Booking.com's expectations of

acceptable content for travellers and supply partners and include specific reference to

discriminatory language and hate speech as well as content promoting violence, discriminatory

language or hatred against a person or groups. Our terms and conditions for supply partners

require them to respect the fundamental rights of customers and to not engage in or allow

discrimination. We also have a range of content moderation policies and enforcement options

in place.



Unfortunately, discriminatory beliefs and values are present in society and are likely to be

expressed when bringing together people in the context of travel and tourism. While all users

could potentially experience discriminatory behaviour, it is more likely to be directed at people

belonging to groups with protected characteristics (e.g., discrimination on the basis of race,

colour, ethnicity, nationality, country of origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender, gender

identity or expression and marital or familial status, or actual or perceived disability). We have,

on some occasions, received reports with allegations of discriminatory behaviour. We take

seriously and address any reports of misconduct from travellers or supply partners including

allegations of discriminatory behaviour, and take appropriate and proportionate action

(including suspension and removal from the platform) where necessary. Users and employees

may report discriminatory conduct on the platform via our customer service teams or via the

company’s Compliance helpline reporting function.



Our Trust and Safety and Content Moderation teams and processes have generally been

effective in identifying discrimination on our platform (as expressed via content on the

platform) and subsequently removing or addressing such content or conduct (giving regard to

key considerations including freedom of speech and expression). That said, content moderation

and discrimination detection systems may well have some limitations due to the difficulties in

detecting certain types of discriminatory content (e.g., local dialects or symbols). It can also be

challenging for automated tooling to determine and analyse the context of a particular

exchange.



Discriminatory behaviour could have potential to be distressing and harmful for the individual

at whom it is directed. Some consequences of discriminatory behaviour may be remediable

(e.g., compelling a supply partner to honour the terms of a reservation or removing

discriminatory content); but we recognise that the impact of the discriminatory intent and

expression, once experienced, can have psychological and other impacts that are difficult to

remediate fully or at all.



10

Tier 2



Illegal content



Risk of abuse or misuse of service by publishing of listings for fraudulent purposes (content

relating to illegal activities)



Our standard terms and conditions for our supply partners are designed to ensure that they

comply with relevant legal obligations at a minimum. We have extensive content moderation

practices and processes designed to identify and remove content within a listing that is likely to

mislead, deceive or confuse our travellers. Furthermore, we utilise human and machine

intelligence to monitor offerings on our platform and to safeguard its integrity against

fraudulent actors.



However, fraudsters or purported service providers could seek to abuse our platform for

improper purposes. This could include publishing non-existent properties listed for the purpose

of extracting fraudulent payments or obtaining traveller details for illicit purposes, or listing

properties without the owner’s consent. We conduct risk-based due diligence on our supply

partners including having verification methods in place aimed at verifying the location of

properties and utilising machine learning models to identify fraudulent properties. Those

efforts may, however, be limited by a number of factors including the availability of information

against which we validate the location of the properties and reliability of verification methods

in some markets.



Fraudulent listings may result in some range of harm to travellers - including paying for or

arriving at properties that in reality may not exist, incurring additional expenses from having to

make replacement travel plans, or inconvenience or other loss of comfort and enjoyment.

While we take any impact on our travellers seriously, given the damage suffered here is

principally (though not entirely) financial in nature, the harm is generally more remediable than

in other areas where psychological or physical impacts could occur.



Risk that illegal hate speech may be available on the platform (content that is illegal in

itself)



Our Content Standards and Guidelines and our Customer Terms of Service set out

Booking.com's expectations of what is not acceptable content for travellers and supply

partners to include in reviews, images and listings. These guidelines also specifically address



11

hate speech and discriminatory language as well as content promoting violence, discriminatory

language or hatred against a person or groups. We have robust systems in place to detect any

such harmful content on Booking.com. However, moderation in regards to hate speech can be

challenging due to difficulties in detecting this type of content and analysing or accounting for

context when using automated tools.



The nature of Booking.com as a transaction-focused platform with a specific and narrow focus

(travel arrangements) renders the likelihood of travellers or supply partners sharing high-risk

illegal content (such as hate speech) lower than on other platforms that are content-focused.

The Booking.com service does not ordinarily allow for direct interaction between travellers.

However, the mere existence of communication channels on any platform, including

Booking.com, presents some possibility of the use of hate speech.



Where these types of illegal and harmful content do materialise, the severity of the impact on

the traveller may be significant and may not always be fully remediable (e.g., in the case of

psychological distress).



Risk that child sexual abuse material / sexual exploitation material may be available on the

platform (content that is illegal in itself)



Booking.com's Content Standards and Guidelines (including our content moderation policy)

prohibits content that contains sexually explicit material including content that sexually

exploits children or presents them in a sexual manner. We also prohibit content that is deemed

legally restricted based on local laws or content that is obscene, offensive or not appropriate

for all audiences. We have automated detection mechanisms to moderate images containing

nudity and images that are sexual in nature.



The likelihood of child sexual abuse material being uploaded to Booking.com is low given the

platform’s narrow purpose of offering travel experiences and reservations. In addition, there are

limited features on Booking.com that enable the sharing of images.



However, we recognize that if it were to occur, the severity of impact on the traveller may be

significant and that impact may not always be fully remediable (e.g., in the case of

psychological distress).



12

Risk that the platform may be used for the sharing of illegal non-consensual private images

(content that is illegal in itself)



Booking.com’s content moderation policy prohibits any content of an adult nature - including

content that contains sexually explicit material, whether or not consensual. While the nature of

Booking.com and its intended use make it unlikely that users of the service would share illegal

non-consensual private images on Booking.com, we recognize that if it were to occur, the

severity of impact on the traveller may be significant and that impact may not always be fully

remediable.



Risk of abuse or misuse of the service for human trafficking (content relating to illegal

activities / fundamental rights)



We are cognizant of the risk that Booking.com may be abused or misused by third parties for

the purpose of human trafficking and sexual exploitation, in contravention of our terms and

conditions. We have processes in place to mitigate human trafficking risks focused on

accommodation providers - including internal human trafficking prevention guidelines, internal

and external training and awareness raising efforts, and content moderation guidelines and

controls over information that is included in the promotion of service listings on Booking.com.



We recognize that harm caused by human trafficking and sexual exploitation, among other

illegal practices, is severe, with high degrees of physical and psychological harm. These harms

may not be fully remediable. Our assessment has determined that the risk that travellers or

supply partners would promote such activities on Booking.com (whether explicitly or

surreptitiously) is inherently low, and further reduced by the existing mitigation measures at

Booking.com.



These are and remain important areas of attention for many companies operating in the

hospitality industry and we are committed to continuously evolving our efforts to reduce the

risk of the services in our platform being abused or misused for the purpose of human

trafficking and sexual exploitation.



13

Fundamental rights



Risk of unfair commercial practices due to misleading descriptions, pictures or illegal

charges (consumer protection)



Booking.com embraces a customer centric culture which places our customers at the centre of

everything we do. Additionally, we maintain a broad range of controls and resources designed

to prevent unfair practices in line with legal obligations in the EU. These include our team of

experienced consumer law and compliance professionals charged with promoting compliance

with relevant rules and regulations.



The harm associated with unfair commercial practices could range from minor financial impacts

to distress caused by travel experiences that do not meet our travellers’ expectations. As such,

while still important, we consider that the severity of the impact falls on the lower end of the

spectrum and it is likely that most harms will be remediable. We continually adopt best

practices and technologies to monitor and meet our obligations to travellers to ensure we

remain vigilant with respect to unfair commercial practices.



Risk of data breaches (protection of personal data)



The nature of the Booking.com service is such that it invites travellers and supply partners to

only provide certain personal data (including names, physical or electronic addresses and, in

some cases, financial information) that is necessary to complete transactions on the platform.

However, data of this nature may be of interest to ill-intentioned actors and cyber attackers, for

illicit purposes including fraud. Given the volume of potential transactions on the platform, and

the ubiquitous nature of cyber threats in e-commerce generally, there is some likelihood of a

digital threat or breach (phishing, malware, etc.) materialising.



While risks of this nature could occur in a number of ways, we consider that they generally fall

into two categories:



● attempts to compromise our own systems via phishing, malware, human intelligence or

other direct attacks on our platform; or



● attempts to obtain traveller or other data indirectly via traveller or partner account

take-overs.



14

Booking.com complies with relevant laws designed to protect personal data, but our

commitment to data security goes beyond compliance with legal requirements. We regularly

enhance our defences against cyber attacks and online fraud attempts by leveraging industry

best practices and technologies and have a dedicated team of cyber security professionals led

by our Chief Information Security Officer. Our cybersecurity, fraud detection/prevention and

data protection measures are generally effective in preventing attacks that seek to compromise

our platform or harvest personal data processed within our platform. Additionally, we maintain

measures to detect traveller and supply partner account take-overs, including working with

and providing education and awareness to partners and travellers on identifying potential

attacks and avoiding them.



However, even in the event of a breach, the impact is generally remediable - as the harm may

in most cases be limited to financial loss. That said, some impacts may be more difficult to

remedy (e.g., in cases of identity theft that go beyond immediate or confined financial loss).



Risk of unnecessary or disproportionate government data requests (protection of personal

data)



Booking.com may, from time to time, receive requests for traveller or supply partner data from

government authorities (often as part of regulatory enforcement or investigation matters). We

comply with relevant laws in the EU and other jurisdictions where we operate while applying a

rigorous focus on protecting the personal data as well as the rights and freedoms of users who

provide data. We reject requests that cannot be confirmed as legitimate, necessary and

proportionate. We employ specific teams, processes and procedures to ensure requests by

government authorities are addressed in consideration of lawfulness, data minimization and

other privacy principles to safeguard individual rights and freedoms across all users of our

platform.



While the vast majority of requests we receive come from within the EU, we acknowledge that

there can be broad variance in rule of law applications in various countries - including the

extent to which requests for information are legitimate, necessary and proportionate. We

recognize that data requests from some countries may not comport with these parameters and

that such requests, if complied with, may have significant adverse impacts on the user

concerned depending on the purposes for which that data is requested. Our dedicated teams

are experienced in handling these risks and our processes have proved effective in significantly

reducing the likelihood that inappropriate requests will be fulfilled.



15

Risk that the platform may be used for the sharing of highly personal information of users

(right to respect for private and family life)



Our Customer Terms of Service prohibits conduct that infringes on the privacy rights of any

users. Our Guest review removal conditions make clear that Booking.com will not accept any

reviews that contain unauthorised information relating to an identified or identifiable natural

person. We have content moderation policies and we use automated systems to address the

risk of sharing highly personal information of users. The severity of impact on travellers, if their

highly personal information were shared on our platform, would vary depending on the nature

of the information disclosed. Such impact may generally be remediable by removing the

content concerned from the platform.



Risks that the platform and its recommender systems may use personal data / aggregated

personal data in a way that is not necessary for the stated purpose in the Privacy notices

(protection of personal data); or in a way that could result in unjustified discrimination

(non-discrimination)



Clarity and transparency with respect to how we use our travellers’ and supply partners’

personal data is important to us and to our users. Our user Privacy Statement and the “How

we work” section on our website describes the types of personal data collected and how it is

used by Booking.com.



We rely on certain personal data, such as IP addresses of users browsing our platform, in order

to show relevant content such as language and appropriate currency. In order to provide our

services, we require certain other personal data such as name and email address and may

utilise aggregated personal data for analysis and service improvements. Logged-in users have

the option to provide and store additional personal data or preferences in their accounts.



However, we do not intentionally collect special categories of personal data (such as racial and

ethnic origin, sexual orientation etc., as defined under the GDPR) for use in our recommender

systems. In those instances when we may use profiling (as defined under the GDPR) in a

recommender system, the user is given the option to opt-out of personalised

recommendations. This means the user will view service recommendations without our

recommender systems using profiling.



While there may be a possibility that aggregate personal data may be used in a way that

stretches beyond users’ expectations, the nature of services offered on the platform, and the



16

type of personal data collected about users, means that impact of such use beyond the stated

purpose in our user Privacy Statement and the “How we work” section on our website would

likely be minimal. In addition, given that we do not currently use special categories of personal

data for personalised recommendations, we consider it unlikely that our recommender systems

would result in discrimination.



Risk that content may be available on the platform promoting discriminatory beliefs, values

or harmful stereotypes (non-discrimination)



As noted elsewhere in this document, with respect to discriminatory behaviour, discriminatory

beliefs and values are present in society and carry some likelihood of expression when bringing

together people in the context of travel and tourism. While all users could potentially be

recipients of discriminatory behaviour, it is most likely to be directed at people belonging to

groups with protected characteristics (e.g. discrimination on the basis of race, colour, ethnicity,

nationality, country of origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or expression

and marital or familial status, or actual or perceived disability). We have identified instances of

discriminatory content on the platform. The instances we have identified more commonly relate

to general discriminatory statements directed at a specific group rather than instances of

discriminatory behaviour targeted at specific people (covered as a Tier 1 risk).



Content moderation, though generally effective, may have some limitations due to the

difficulties in detecting certain types of discriminatory content, and for automated efforts to

determine and analyse context. However, we continue to ensure our policies are robust,

effective and in line with industry best practices (while respecting freedom of speech and

expression). We also have enforcement options in place, and our Trust and Safety processes

are designed to identify and address discriminatory content on the platform and utilise machine

learning systems to detect such content.



Risk that content moderation systems may perform less optimally in certain languages

potentially resulting in over / under removal of harmful content (non-discrimination)



Our content moderation processes utilise machine learning models in 43 different languages to

detect inappropriate content. Such content is subsequently reviewed manually either by a

native speaker or in the absence of a native speaker, the content is translated to English.

Booking.com currently does not have human moderators in every language that the platform

supports. As such, the enforcement of our content moderation policies may have some

limitations in cases where we do not have a native speaker available, particularly where



17

geographic or cultural context is required and where such context may not be readily captured

by machine translation.



We recognize that under-removal (i.e., failing to remove content that ought to be removed)

could result in some range of harm depending on how harmful the content is (e.g.,

discriminatory content). The potential harm or impact of over-removal is lower. However, given

the transactional (versus user generated content-focused) nature of our platform, the volume

of potentially removable content is relatively low and the proportion of users who might be

affected by under / over removal of content is similarly low.



Risk of harmful misuse of the service by minors (respect for the rights of the child)



Booking.com is not intended for use by or directed at minors. Our Customer Terms of Service

require users to be at least 16 years old to use the platform. In addition to these terms, there

are practical barriers which render our services less accessible to minors. In particular, in order

to access many of our services, a credit card or other form of online payment method is

required to make a reservation. We consider this reduces the practical risk: these types of

payment methods are generally only accessible to persons above the age of 18 in the EU.

Despite this, we have measures and policies in place that ensure that only safe and appropriate

content is displayed to all users of our services, including minors.



The protection of minors online is of critical importance, and the severity of impact on minors

from a range of online activities may be high. Children who access online travel platforms like

Booking.com to make travel arrangements without adult consent may be doing so in higher risk

situations e.g., to engage in dangerous activities like drug use or self-harm. Our assessment

indicates that there is low probability of this risk materialising given the minimum age

requirement on our platform and the logistical barriers to access (e.g., the payment method

required to make a reservation). In rare instances where minors are endangered by using our

platform or services, our Trust \& Safety team and relevant processes are designed to respond

to such occurrences with higher priority when we are made aware of them.



18

Gender based violence, public health, physical and mental well-being



Risk that users may engage in online behaviour that amounts to, incites or encourages

gender-based violence (gender-based violence)



Our Content Standards and Guidelines and our Customer Terms of Service set out

Booking.com's expectations of what is not acceptable content for travellers and supply

partners to include in reviews, images and listings. These guidelines also specifically address

content promoting violence against a person or groups.



Due to the nature of Booking.com as a transactional-focused platform, the likelihood of users

engaging in online behaviour that amounts to, incites, condones or encourages gender based

violence is lower than on platforms that are content-focused. However, the mere existence of

communication channels on any platform, including Booking.com, presents some possibility of

such online behaviour. We recognise that if such conduct were to occur, the impact is likely to

be significant and difficult to remediate.



We maintain a range of content moderation policies and enforcement options as well as an

experienced Trust \& Safety team and machine learning to mitigate this risk whenever such

behaviour is identified. However, we recognize that moderation may have limitations due to the

difficulties in current technology detecting content that may amount to, incite, or encourage

gender-based violence, and that there are challenges in analysing or accounting for context

when using automated tools.



Risk that users may engage in abusive behaviour towards other users on the platform

(physical and mental well-being)



We maintain a range of content moderation policies and enforcement options in place to

mitigate this risk. However, moderation may have limitations due to the difficulties in detecting

certain types of abusive content, and analysing or accounting for context when using

automated tools.



Users of the Booking.com platform have limited opportunities for user-to-user interaction. As

such, abusive behaviour towards other users on Booking.com is only possible on specific

channels of the platform (for example, in guest reviews or in partner to traveller messaging).



We recognise that abusive behaviour can have serious psychological impacts on individuals,



19

particularly when it is specifically directed at a specific person, and can be difficult to remediate

fully.



Risk that harmful (but legal) content on the platform may impact well-being of users

(physical and mental well-being)



Our Customer Terms of Service set out what is and is not allowed on the platform, including

inappropriate behaviour (e.g., violence, threats or invasion of privacy). Our content moderation

policies and guidelines prohibit content that promotes or facilitates serious physical or mental

health violence against others. The guidelines also specifically condemn content that promotes

violence, discriminatory language or hatred against a person based on who they are, as well as

content that harasses, bullies or threatens others or is obscene or offensive or shocking.



Due to the nature of Booking.com as a transactional-focused (as opposed to a user-generated

content-focused) platform, the likelihood of users sharing legal but harmful content is

relatively lower than platforms that are content focused. However, the existence of

communication channels on any platform, including Booking.com, presents some possibility for

harmful content. Where these types of harmful content do materialise, the severity of the

impact on the traveller may be significant and could be more difficult to remediate fully.

Booking.com offers reporting mechanisms for travellers to report such content. All reports are

addressed and if appropriate, proportionate remedial action is taken.



Tier 3



Illegal content



Risk that intellectual property may be illegally available on the platform (content that is

illegal in itself)



By design and nature of operation, Booking.com imposes strict limitations on the type of

content that travellers and supply partners can post on the platform. These limitations

naturally curtail the posting of content that is protected by intellectual property laws and our

content standards and guidelines include specific reference to Intellectual Property.



As such, we generally do not encounter intellectual property issues at scale. Where we do,

they tend to relate to copyright claims on photographs and we address those through our

moderation and related processes. Where this risk materialises, it is very unlikely to severely



20

impact users at scale as any potential harm is more likely to be some financial loss to the

intellectual property owner. Such losses are more readily remediable.



Risk that content on the platform may constitute illegal defamation (content illegal in

itself)



Our Customer Terms of Service set out what is and is not allowed on the platform, including

inappropriate behaviour (e.g., violence, threats or invasion of privacy). Our content moderation

policy also prohibits potentially defamatory statements against individuals.



Due to the transactional-focused nature of the Booking.com platform, the likelihood of

travellers or supply partners sharing high-risk illegal content (like defamation) is significantly

lower than on other platforms that are content-focused which further reduces this risk.



With respect to defamation, an added layer of complexity is the non-existence of a harmonised

definition across the EU and often the fact that potentially defamatory content requires factual

assessment.



Risk that content on the platform may promote sale of illegal products and services (e.g.

drugs, gambling, underage drinking) (content relating to illegal activities)



Our Content Standards and Guidelines prohibit content that is illegal or otherwise restricted

under local laws, including content that offers, sells, advertises or facilitates the sale of

regulated or restricted goods and services. Our guest review removal conditions stipulate that

reviews promoting, supporting or inciting illegal activities will not be made available on the

platform and our content moderation policy prohibits such content.



We have, on some occasions, identified content on our platform which promotes sale of

restricted items through listings, reviews, etc. through our content moderation systems. We

take down such content upon identification. While we recognise that the harm caused by

different types of illegal products and services or counterfeit goods may vary, such harm is

generally remediable (e.g., by removing such content on the platform).



21

Risk that content relating to war crimes, genocide, crimes against humanity or terrorism

may be available on the platform (content illegal in itself)



Our Content Standards and Guidelines prohibit content promoting hate, or violence, including

violence against others on the basis of who they are and content that promotes, facilitates or

encourages any kind of violence against others. Booking.com's content moderation policy

provides ground for rejecting content that supports, ignores, or trivialises war crimes,

genocides, and crimes against humanity.



Due to the nature of Booking.com as a transaction-focused platform as opposed to a social

media platform, it is highly unlikely that the platform would be used to disseminate such

content. In the unlikely event these risks were to materialise, it is equally unlikely to cause

significant impact at scale, as any harm may be remediated by removing the content concerned.



Fundamental rights



Risk that content on the platform may be unjustifiably removed and risk that users are not

able to appeal content removals and/or report or appeal potentially violating content

(freedom of expression and information)



The vast majority of information on Booking.com relates to travel services, and therefore it is

unlikely that the removal of content on our site would be considered to harm or materially

impact the freedom of speech of users.



In addition, we have expanded our mechanisms for appealing content moderation decisions as

part of our DSA compliance efforts and further protect freedom of speech of users. Therefore,

the likelihood of content being wrongly removed and users wanting to appeal the content

removal decision, or of a removal being disproportionate or unnecessary, is low.



Risk that the platform may be used for the purposes of stalking (right to respect for private

and family life)



The transactional nature of the Booking.com platform is such that it is unlikely to be used for

stalking. Opportunities for user-to-user interaction are limited and any reviews that contain

unauthorised information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person are not allowed

under our existing content moderation policies.



22

Risk that services or features on the platform may not function equitably for users with

certain disabilities or limited digital literacy (non-discrimination)



Our Customer Service team enables accessibility requests to cater for the needs of those with

disabilities and digital literacy challenges. We provide options for users of the Booking.com

service to identify their preference for seeing listings with accessibility criteria, which reduces

the risk of disabled travellers being recommended inappropriate options.



Making our platform accessible remains a focus area for us. We have and will continue to make

enhancements to our platform for making it more accessible to persons with disabilities or

limited digital literacy and will be doing so in line with the requirements of the European

Accessibility Act (2025).



Risk that platform features (e.g. Customer Service support) may provide inconsistent

experience to users across different languages and markets (non-discrimination)



Booking.com is available in all official European languages - ensuring equal access to our

services across all European markets. We recognise that there may be instances when users

who only speak less common languages may have a different experience of using Booking.com

than those who speak commonly spoken languages. For example, our Customer Services may

not have speakers of all European languages available at all times. However, this risk is only

likely to arise in a small number of cases. Where it does arise, given the nature of the

Booking.com service, the severity of issues is likely to be on the lower end of the spectrum.



Risk that personally identifiable information about a child may become available on the

platform (respect for the rights of children)



Our policies prohibit unauthorised photographs of young children from being posted where the

child is identifiable (e.g., where their face is visible) and the occurrence of such images on

Booking.com, in practice, is not common.



As noted above in addressing the risk of harmful misuse of the service by minors, Booking.com

is not intended for use by children and we do not encourage the sharing of personal

information. Very little personally identifiable information on children (e.g., names of room

occupants or date of birth when required for flight reservations) is collected by Booking.com.



23

Risk that users may submit reviews containing false information (consumer protection)



Accurate and non-misleading reviews of accommodation properties and other travel offerings

are an important feature of the Booking.com service. To that end, we have put in place

restrictions around who can submit reviews. We have content moderation systems in place to

ensure that in the instances it may occur, misleading content is removed from Booking.com.

This applies to both reviews submitted by legitimate travellers that may contain false or

misleading information as well as reviews submitted by individuals that intend to circumvent

our controls by posting reviews without making use of the service subject to the review.



In respect of reviews submitted by supply partners, our Content Standards and Guidelines

detail that content included in reviews should not mislead, deceive or confuse Booking.com

travellers and that supply partners should not impersonate travellers. Commercial /

self-promotional content in reviews is not allowed on Booking.com, and is addressed by our

moderation teams. Our policies do not permit reviews that contain fake content and we have a

number of measures in place to identify and moderate such content. We use machine learning

models to detect such reviews and we conduct investigations into suspected violations of our

policies.



Guest reviews play an important role in aiding the exercise of consumer choice. We take the

integrity of the reviews on our platform seriously. Naturally, our assessment confirms that

reviews containing false or misleading information may have the effect of misinforming

travellers and may contribute to them making particular travel arrangements. Some of that

impact is remediable by removing false or misleading reviews. Travel reviews are inherently

subjective and thus have some likelihood of inaccuracy. As a check against that risk of

inaccuracy, supply partners can proactively challenge reviews that may not seem accurate. The

combination of our travel review parameters and the enablement provided to supply partners

reduces the likelihood of misleading reviews.



Risk that geo-pricing on the platform may result in unjustified discrimination (consumer

protection)



Customers located in the European Economic Area (EEA) have access to the same content,

prices and conditions on Booking.com. This ensures that we remain compliant with various

legislations that regulate discriminatory access conditions.



24

Booking.com, however, may show different prices depending on user characteristics other than

location. For example, certain supply partners may be able to give targeted discounts to a

specific category of customers based on the ‘Genius’ Loyalty Program.



Gender based violence, public health, physical and mental well-being



Risk that content is available on the platform that glorifies or encourages eating disorders,

self harm, or suicide



Our Content Standards and Guidelines and our Customer Terms of Service set out

Booking.com's expectations of what is not acceptable content for travellers and supply

partners to include in reviews, images and listings, and further specify that content and reviews

should be travel-related. While we acknowledge that exposure to such content can have

serious impacts on the mental and physical well-being of individuals, our assessment has

shown that the transaction-focused nature of Booking.com platform renders the probability of

such content being available on the platform very low.



Risks that are not present on / stemming from the Booking.com platform



Our assessment has concluded that the below mentioned list of risks are not present on / do

not stem from the design and functioning of the Booking.com platform.



Fundamental rights



Risk of negative effects on the right to human dignity related to the design, functioning and

use of the platform's services and related systems (right to human dignity)



The nature of the operation of the Booking.com platform does not reach the threshold for

impact on human dignity. No risks reaching that threshold were identified as part of our

assessment.



Risk of negative effects on freedom and pluralism of the media related to the design,

functioning and use of the platform's services and related systems (freedom of expression

and information)



The information available on Booking.com relates to opportunities to travel and engage in

tourism-related activities and is clearly presented in that context. On that basis it is highly



25

unlikely that any such content could be perceived to undermine the freedom and pluralism of

the media.



Civic discourse, electoral processes, public security



Risk of negative effects on civic discourse, electoral processes or public security



Our assessment identified no risk in relation to negative effects on civic discourse, electoral

processes or public security. Information and services available on the Booking.com platform

relate to opportunities to travel and engage in tourism-related activities and are clearly

presented in that context. On that basis, it is unlikely that any content or behaviour on

Booking.com could have a material effect (let alone a negative effect) on civic discourse,

electoral processes or public security.



Gender based violence, physical and mental well-being



Risk of negative impacts on public health and minors due to design, functioning and use of

the platform and related services besides risks previously identified (public health and

minors)



As the information available and disseminated on Booking.com relates exclusively to

opportunities to travel and engage in tourism-related activities and is clearly presented in that

context, it is considered highly unlikely that any such content could be linked to negative

impacts on the protection of public health or minors.



26

Conclusion



As noted at the outset of this document, our risk assessment was conducted taking into

account the particular parameters outlined in the DSA and utilising an established framework

for assessing impacts on people and society. The exercise was supported by advisors and

consultants, including a global non-profit sustainable business network and consultancy. Our

assessment and the findings indicate that Booking.com (the platform and the services offered

thereon) do not pose significant systemic risks to EU citizens. First, we are a

transaction-focused platform and our services are not designed to be binged or addictive.

Second, our platform offers limited opportunities for interaction between travellers and we do

not provide personalised user-generated homepages or news feeds that allow for

dissemination of a broad range of content types. Third, our platform is generally not for use by,

or of a nature that appeals to, minors.



We recognize, nonetheless, that no online platform that brings people together in the way that

we do can operate without encountering any risks. Through our assessment, we have identified

a number of potential risks, primarily relating to illegal content and certain fundamental rights

with the most prominent risk being the risk that users may engage in discriminatory behaviour

towards other users on the platform. Even though prohibited by our terms and conditions and

policies, the risks we have identified stem largely from abuse or inauthentic use of our services.



By and large, we have existing safety features and functions to address and further mitigate

the risks we identified, ranging from content moderation technology and proficiencies to our

trust and safety program. Booking.com remains committed to continuously enhancing the

integrity and safety of our platform for all users and to contributing to the overall integrity of

our industry. We look forward to sharing with the European Commission a report on mitigation

measures we plan to take in respect of the risks identified in this report, and as required by the

DSA, in due course.
