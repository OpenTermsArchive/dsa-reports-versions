WGCZ_Risk Assessment Report 3



1\. Introduction



1.1. Purpose and scope of the report



This report presents a risk assessment conducted by WebGroup Czech Republic a.s. (also referred to

as “we” or “WGCZ”), operator of the xvideos.com platform which has been designated as Very Large

Online Platform (VLOP)in accordance with Article 33(4) of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 (Digital Services

Act or DSA). The primary purpose of the risk assessment is to:



 identify and evaluate risks associated with all aspects of our operations that could negatively

impact users, society, or our ability to comply with all relevant regulations,



 specifically address risks related to the DSA, including data transparency, reporting obligations,

risk of dissemination of illegal content, negative effects for the exercise of fundamental rights,

effects in relation to gender-based violence, risks for public health and minors, consequences

to the person’s physical and mental well-being and advertiser and commercial content integrity.



The scope of this report encompasses all processes, systems, and controls relevant to our online

platform's functionality and compliance with regulations. This includes, but is not limited to, content

moderation, user safety, data privacy, advertising practices, and reporting procedures. Identified risks

are assessed based on their likelihood of occurrence and potential impact on various aspects, such as

user trust, public safety and health, protection of minors, regulatory compliance, material and immaterial

damages and our overall business objectives.



The conducted risk assessment considered the diverse regional and linguistic landscape of our user

base. Despite the complexity due to such a vast landscape, we fully recognize the importance of tailoring

our approach to mitigate risks specific to different regions and languages. Our approach to the

challenges the linguistic landscape poses in front of us is driven by principles as recited by DSA – those

of risk-based approach and proportionality. These principles are reflected not only in our risk

management system but are adopted across all related activities.



The report comprises three parts to be read in conjunction with each other:



(i) the present risk assessment and risk management report;

(ii) the risk management dashboard; and

(iii) the risk register.



1.2. Risk management framework



The risk assessment was conducted following the principles and guidelines established in the

international standard ISO 31000: Risk Management. This standard provides a comprehensive

framework for organizations to effectively identify, assess, treat, monitor, and communicate risks. During

this assessment, we particularly focused on the standard's emphasis on continuous improvement and

the importance of involving top management and other relevant stakeholders throughout the risk

assessment process.



Building upon the principles of ISO 31000, we recognize the crucial role of leadership in fostering a

strong risk management culture. Our governing body demonstrates a clear commitment to risk

management by actively engaging in discussions and providing the necessary resources. This

commitment translates into tangible actions, as evidenced by our top management devoting sufficient

time and resources to consider measures related to risk management and actively participating in

decisions regarding risk mitigation strategies.



The ISO 31000 framework aligns well with the requirements of the Digital Services Act (DSA) for Very

Large Online Platforms (VLOPs). The standard's focus on systematic risk identification, assessment,

PRIVATE \& CONFIDENTIAL



WGCZ_Risk Assessment Report 4



and treatment ensures we proactively address potential issues related to data transparency, reporting

obligations, and content integrity, as mandated by the DSA.



We chose ISO 31000 as the foundation for our risk assessment process and risk management system

due to several factors:



 ISO 31000 offers a well-established, internationally recognized framework for risk management.

It provides a structured approach that encompasses all stages of the risk management process,

from identifying risks to evaluating, treating, monitoring, and communicating them;



 while the DSA itself doesn’t explicitly mandate the use of ISO 31000, the standard’s core

principles align well with the objectives outlined in the DSA. These principles emphasize

proactive risk identification, risk mitigation strategies, and continuous improvement – all crucial

aspects of a robust risk management program under the DSA;



 the flexibility of ISO 31000 allows us to tailor the approach to the specific needs of our platform

and the evolving regulatory landscape. We can integrate additional considerations specific to

the DSA while leveraging the core principles of the standard.



Hence, utilizing ISO 31000 for our risk assessment and risk management process leverages several

advantages:



 provides a well-established and systematic approach to managing risks across the organization,



 encourages a proactive and continuous improvement cycle for identifying, assessing,

and mitigating risks,



 facilitates clear communication and collaboration among stakeholders regarding risk

identification, evaluation, and treatment strategies.



1.3. Methodology used for risk assessment



Risk Assessment Steps



1. Defining the scope and objectives of the assessment



2. Employing a variety of techniques to systematically identify potential risks relevant to our

operations and DSA compliance



3. Assessing the likelihood and potential impact of each identified risk using a pre-defined scoring

system



4. Prioritizing risks based on their likelihood and impact scores to determine which require further

mitigation efforts



5. Developing and implementing appropriate risk mitigation strategies to address identified risks



6. Continuously monitoring the effectiveness of risk controls and reviewing the risk management

process at regular intervals



Data collection



A combination of data collection techniques was used to gather information for this assessment,

including:



 internal workshops with relevant stakeholders from various departments (e.g., legal,

compliance, IT, content moderation),

PRIVATE \& CONFIDENTIAL



WGCZ_Risk Assessment Report 5



 interviews with key personnel to gain in-depth insights into specific processes and potential

risks,



 review of internal documents and policies related to data management, content moderation, and

regulatory compliance, including the Terms of Service, with specific focus on our content

moderation system as a whole and design of our recommender system and algorithms,



 benchmarking against industry best practices and other VLOPs.



Risk identification



In order to comprehensively identify potential risks, we carried out the following activities:



 brainstorming sessions with cross-functional teams to generate a broad range of risk scenarios,



 scenario planning exercises to consider potential future events and their impact on our

operations,



 review of existing risk registers and industry threat intelligence to identify relevant risks specific

to VLOPs.



Risk assessment criteria



A scoring system was used to assess the likelihood and impact of each identified risk. The scoring

criteria were defined based on pre-determined scales considering factors such as frequency of

occurrence, severity of consequences, and potential for business continuity disruption.



Risks and regional linguistic aspects



We acknowledge the importance of regional and linguistic variations in user behavior and content

moderation. Our risk assessment process incorporates our multilingual content moderation team. We

employ a team of content moderators proficient in various languages, including, but not limited to,

German, French, Italian, English, Spanish, Polish, Russian, Slovak and Czech allowing for a nuanced

understanding of content across different regions and effective content moderation.



We understand the importance of effective content moderation across a variety of languages spoken

within the European Union. To achieve this, we leverage a two-pronged approach that combines the

expertise of our multilingual moderation team with the assistance of a reliable translation software.



Our moderation team is comprised of individuals with understanding of the cultural nuances and

sensitivities present within the EU. This allows them to effectively assess content in their native

languages, ensuring a high degree of accuracy and comprehension.



Risk documentation



The identified risks and their assessments are documented in a form of a Risk Register. This register

includes details such as risk category, risk description, likelihood and impact scores, inherent and

residual final risk scores (values), and recommended risk management treatment based on selected

Risk management strategies. The risk register is a live document and serves as a central repository for

ongoing monitoring and review of risks.



2\. Risk identification



A comprehensive approach to risk identification was undertaken, involving participation from a wide

range of stakeholders across WGCZ. This included representatives from departments such as:

PRIVATE \& CONFIDENTIAL



WGCZ_Risk Assessment Report 6



 Legal and Compliance



 Content Moderation



 IT Security and operations



Through workshops, brainstorming sessions, and individual interviews, stakeholders contributed their

unique perspectives and expertise to identify potential risks related to our operations and compliance

with the DSA. During the risk identification process, particular emphasis was placed on potential risks

associated with various aspects of the DSA that VLOPs need to comply with (see Chapter 2.1 for more

detail). This included:



 data transparency obligations,



 reporting requirements to regulator,



 content moderation practices, where we focused primarily on definition of risk scenarios related

to detecting and removing illegal content, preventing manipulation of users, and protecting

minors online were identified,



 advertiser and commercial content integrity, where we aimed at exploring potential risks

associated with misleading advertising practices and ensuring the integrity of commercial

content displayed on our platform.



By employing a multi-pronged approach that incorporates industry best practices, we aimed to create a

comprehensive picture of potential risks that could threaten the objects of protection outlined in the

regulation. This includes risks that could negatively impact:



 users, their health and safety, fundamental rights (such as privacy and freedom of expression),

and overall well-being. This could involve risks associated with exposure to harmful content,

manipulation, or privacy breaches;

 society, such as the spread of misinformation or threats to external security; and

 our organization, despite the primary focus, we acknowledge that risks to user safety and

society can ultimately impact our organization through reputational damage, regulatory actions,

or user loss.



Our risk assessment focuses on the most significant risks relevant to the xvideos.com platform. While

the DSA identifies a broad range of potential risks, some are not directly applicable to our service. For

instance, the risk of negative effects on civic discourse and electoral processes (as per Art. 34(c) DSA)

is considered minimal for our platform, which primarily focuses on adult entertainment content.



2.1. Risk Categories



This chapter outlines the various categories of risks identified during the assessment. Each category

aligns with potential areas of concern regarding our operations and compliance with the DSA.

By comprehensively understanding these risks, we developed effective mitigation strategies in order to

maintain xvideos.com a responsible online platform.



Illegal content distribution



 Risks associated with distribution of illegal content on the platform, such as hate speech, violent

content, terrorism-related material, or child sexual abuse content.



 Challenges in effectively detecting and removing illegal content due to factors like volume,

automation limitations, or evolving tactics used by malicious actors.

PRIVATE \& CONFIDENTIAL



WGCZ_Risk Assessment Report 7



 Risk of regulatory sanctions or reputational damage due to failures in preventing the spread of

illegal content.



Adverse effects on fundamental rights



 Risks associated with platform functionalities or content moderation practices that could

negatively impact user rights, such as freedom of expression, privacy, non-discrimination, or

the basic right to human dignity.



 Potential for biased algorithms or content moderation decisions to disproportionately affect

certain user groups.



 Risk of legal challenges or public backlash due to perceived infringements on fundamental

rights.



Manipulation of the platform



 Risks associated with malicious actors manipulating the platform to spread misinformation,

disrupt user experience, or exploit vulnerabilities.



 Potential for techniques like bots, fake accounts, or coordinated inauthentic behavior to

manipulate platform algorithms (which are part of our recommender system) or trends.



 Risk of reputational damage or loss of user trust due to successful platform manipulation

attempts.



Protection of minors



 Risks associated with exposure of minors to harmful content, such as age-inappropriate

material, cyberbullying, or self-harm content.



 Challenges in effectively verifying user age.



 Risk of legal repercussions or public criticism for failing to adequately protect minors to visit the

platform.



Data privacy and protection



 Potential for data breaches, unauthorized access, or misuse of user data.



 Risk of regulatory fines or user churn due to inadequate data privacy protection measures.



Systemic risks



 Potential for algorithmic bias, echo chambers, or filter bubbles to negatively impact user

behavior or societal discourse.



 Risk of platform addiction or manipulation of user behavior.



Transparency and reporting obligations



 Risks associated with inaccurate or incomplete data collection that hinders transparency

reporting to regulator.



 Challenges in meeting complex reporting requirements outlined by the DSA regarding user

activity or content moderation practices etc.

PRIVATE \& CONFIDENTIAL



WGCZ_Risk Assessment Report 8



 Risk of regulatory penalties or reputational damage due to non-compliance with transparency

and reporting obligations.



Advertiser and commercial content integrity



 Risks associated with misleading advertising practices or deceptive commercial content

displayed on the platform.



 Difficulty in effectively detecting and preventing fraudulent advertising or sponsored content that

deceives users.



 Risk of user trust erosion and potential regulatory action due to compromised advertiser and

commercial content integrity.



3\. Risk Assessment



A two-step qualitative risk assessment approach was adopted for this assessment. This approach first

evaluates the inherent risk, which considers the potential impact and likelihood of a risk occurring before

any controls are implemented. Subsequently, the effectiveness of existing controls is assessed to

determine the residual risk, which reflects the remaining risk after existing measures and controls are

taken into account.



3.1. Inherent Risk Assessment



Likelihood assessment criteria: The inherent likelihood of a risk occurring was assessed based on

the following criteria:



 Very unlikely (Score 1): Very low probability of occurring within the next year (e.g., no historical

incidents, strong mitigating controls in place elsewhere)



 Unlikely (Score 2): Low probability of occurring within the next year (e.g., rare historical

occurrences, some potential vulnerabilities)



 Possible (Score 3): Moderate probability of occurring within the next year (e.g., occasional

historical occurrences, some vulnerabilities identified)



 Likely (Score 4): High probability of occurring within the next year (e.g., frequent historical

occurrences, significant vulnerabilities identified)



 Very likely (Score 5): Almost certain to occur within the next year (e.g., ongoing incidents,

critical vulnerabilities identified)



Impact Assessment criteria: The inherent impact of a risk on the organization was assessed based

on the following criteria:



 Insignificant (Score 1): Minimal to no potential harm to users, society, or the organization.

Regulatory intervention is unlikely, and any reputational impact would be isolated.



 Minor (Score 2): Potential for some harm to users (e.g., exposure to inappropriate content) or

society (e.g., spread of misinformation). The organization could face minor reputational damage

or regulatory warnings.

PRIVATE \& CONFIDENTIAL



WGCZ_Risk Assessment Report 9



 Moderate (Score 3): Increased potential for harm to users (e.g., safety risks, privacy breaches)

or society (e.g., manipulation, erosion of trust). The organization could experience moderate

reputational damage or regulatory investigations.



 Major (Score 4): Significant potential for harm to users (e.g., widespread exposure to harmful

content) or society (e.g., manipulation of elections). The organization could face substantial

reputational damage, potential suspension of operations, or significant fines.



 Critical (Score 5): Severe potential for harm to users (e.g., exploitation, psychological harm) or

society (e.g., major disruption of democratic processes). The organization could face severe

reputational damage, license revocation, or complete platform shutdown.



It's important to emphasize that even in instances where the current risk assessment might not predict

significant inherent impact to WGCZ e.g. regulatory fines, lawsuits etc., the potential harm to users and

society (objects of protection) still exists. Our control environment is designed with this dual purpose in

mind. By strengthening our internal controls, we not only safeguard the organization but also protect

users and society from the potential consequences of these risks. This approach ensures a

comprehensive risk management strategy that prioritizes user safety and societal well-being, while

acknowledging the interconnectedness between organizational resilience and the protection of the

objects outlined in the DSA.



An inherent risk score was then calculated by multiplying the inherent likelihood and impact scores

(Score = Likelihood x Impact).



Figure: Risk Value Matrix defined for the purpose of conducting Risk Assessment



3.2. Residual Risk Assessment



Following the inherent risk assessment, existing controls and measures relevant to each risk scenario

were identified and evaluated. The effectiveness and robustness of these controls were considered in

determining the residual risk.



 Control Effectiveness Assessment: The effectiveness of each control was assessed based

on factors such as:



o strength of the control in mitigating the risk,



o frequency of control monitoring and updates,

PRIVATE \& CONFIDENTIAL



WGCZ_Risk Assessment Report 10



o historical performance of the control.



 Residual Risk Determination: Based on the inherent risk score and the effectiveness of

existing controls, a residual risk score was assigned to each risk. The residual risk score reflects

the remaining level of risk after controls are implemented.



Risk prioritization



Risks were then prioritized based on their inherent and residual risk scores. Risk scenarios with scores

higher than Low (with a few exceptions where the residual risk score was determined as Low) was

further analyzed, and mitigation strategies are developed to address them effectively.

4\. Risk assessment results \& Risk management plan



4.1. Risk Assessment results



In accordance with the methodology outlined in Chapter 3, the risk assessment comprehensively

evaluated thirty-eight realistic risk scenarios categorized across the eight risk categories defined in

Chapter 2.1.



Figure: Comparison of Risk Assessment results in the inherent and residual phase of assessment



The inherent risk assessment identified that WGCZ faces higher than inherently low exposure to 30 risk

scenarios. The majority (29 instances) fall within the medium risk category, with only one classified as

high risk. This initial assessment is based on the inherent likelihood and impact of each risk scenario

before considering existing controls.



As documented in the Risk Register, all identified risk scenarios have been mapped to corresponding

measures and controls. The effectiveness of these controls in mitigating risks is evident, as they

demonstrably prevent the materialization of the majority of the risk scenarios.



While the initial risk assessment indicates a well-controlled environment, a high-level overview of risk

by category further indicates the primary areas where WGCZ will focus its risk management efforts:

PRIVATE \& CONFIDENTIAL



WGCZ_Risk Assessment Report 12



4.2. Residual Risk Assessment



The residual risk assessment, which considers the effectiveness of existing controls, identified four risk

scenarios with a score above "Low." These consist of three categorized as "Medium" risk and one

classified as "High" risk.



Figure: Overview of risks requiring additional measures to be implemented



Given the priorities and focus of various stakeholders, we provide detail on especially two areas of our

risk assessment and risk management efforts:



1) Age verification system

2) Gender-based violence and non-consensual sexual acts



Age verification system



WGCZ, alongside many responsible actors across various industries (e.g., motion picture companies,

alcohol and tobacco producers, video game developers, and online gambling platforms), shares a strong

commitment to safeguarding minors from accessing age-restricted content.



We actively participate in industry discussions and experiments related to age verification solutions.



However, current site-based age-gating methods, have not only proven to be easily bypassed, but have

also been fully rejected by users, resulting in an almost complete loss of userbase where they were

applied (close to 90%).



Additionally, the various identity verification methods used pose major security risks in the event of a

data breach, as well as cost issues.



On the other hand, already available parental control tools cannot be bypassed and do not pose any

security or privacy risk, and are free. However their existence and availability may not be sufficiently

known.WGCZ prioritizes user privacy and data protection. We believe a responsible age verification

approach should not come at the expense of these fundamental rights. We are actively exploring

alternative solutions that balance user privacy with effective age verification:



 we collaborate with leading cybersecurity and privacy experts to stay informed about emerging

age verification technologies that prioritize user privacy;

WGCZ_Risk Assessment Report 13



 we closely monitor industry advancements in age verification and adapt our approach as more

robust and secure technologies become available.



Despite the limitations, we employ a multi-layered approach to age verification that includes:



 the platform warns all visitors prior to them viewing any content that it is designed for an adult

audience only;

 users are required to confirm their age during account creation, agreeing to our terms of service

that prohibit underage access;

 age verification prompts appear before accessing age-restricted content;

 we provide educational resources to inform users about the importance of responsible online

behavior and provide detailed guidance on the setup of parental controls for parents and

guardians.



We acknowledge that the current age verification landscape presents a residual risk. However, we are

monitoring developments across the globe for better age gate keeping measures and are committed to

continuous improvement and responsible management of this risk.



Residual risk assessment: Gender-based violence and non-consensual sexual acts



WGCZ stresses that it does not tolerate the display and dissemination of illegal content on any of its

platforms, including content featuring Non-Consensual Intimate Imagery (“NCII”) or Child Sexual Abuse

Material (“CSAM”), and takes all forms of online abuse very seriously. WGCZ has always endeavored

to make its sites safe for all individuals, users and non-users alike, and to support online safety.



As evident from the risk register, the risk assessment identified gender-based violence and non-

consensual sexual acts as key risk scenarios. We acknowledge the potential for these scenarios to

materialize on our platform, and we take a comprehensive approach to identifying, assessing, and

mitigating them. Hence, we dedicated significant resources to thoroughly evaluate this risk:



 we analyzed the potential for content depicting or promoting gender-based violence to be

uploaded to the platform;

 we assessed the possibility of users engaging in abusive or harassing behavior towards others;

 we evaluated the effectiveness of our systems in identifying and removing content related to

gender-based violence, as well as the efficiency of our user reporting tools.



Based on this comprehensive analysis, it needs to be stated that the control environment effectively

mitigates the risk of gender-based violence:



 we perform algorithmic review through digital fingerprinting software; we scan the XVideos

platform for content that has been previously identified as NCII and CSAM. This fingerprint

database is based on Vercury software and is managed by WGCZ;

 we also leverage machine learning algorithms within our "Hive" classification system. This

system proactively identifies and flags content depicting or promoting violence, hate speech,

and other harmful behavior;

 we also use additional software tools for content moderation such as Thorn Safer, a hashing

technology, to identify CSAM content by means of a comparison with records contained in both

the database of the National Center for Exploited and Missing Children (“NCMEC’s”) and the

internal database of the technology supplier, Safer, as well as Google Safe API to detect

possible CSAM content;

 our "Hive" system mentioned above also works hand-in-hand with a dedicated team of trained

moderators. These moderators possess knowledge of online safety best practices, linguistic

and cultural nuances, ensuring accurate review of flagged content. The team of reviewers

browses the XVideos’ site just like regular users, reviewing reported videos and removing any

illegal content and/or content that infringes XVideos’ Terms of Service, whether it be spam,

possible illegal/doubtful content, or some other infringing content, always erring on the side of

caution, i.e., by excluding doubtful material. These content moderators are responsible for

reviewing all potentially illegal content and confirming that the content is NCII or CSAM.

PRIVATE \& CONFIDENTIAL



WGCZ_Risk Assessment Report 14



 we encourage users to report any suspicious activity or content through a user-friendly,

multilingual reporting system (“abuse reporting form”). Every report is promptly reviewed by our

moderation team, and we maintain a zero-tolerance policy for violations. The abuse reporting

form is a tool that allows anyone (be it an individual or a legal entity) to notify WGCZ of the

presence on their service of specific items of information that is considered to be illegal content;

it is easily accessible by electronic means and it is user-friendly.



 we have also recently introduced a trusted flaggers program, in compliance with DSA, which

enables registered trusted flaggers to submit notices via a special account/portal accessible

only by such trusted flaggers. Trusted flaggers are granted exclusive access to a dashboard to

ensure that notices submitted by them are reviewed as a matter of priority and processed and

decided upon without delay. The dashboard also allows the status of such notices to be tracked.



While our current controls have effectively reduced the residual risk of gender-based violence to a low

level, we understand that online threats are constantly evolving. That is why:



 our operations actively research emerging technologies that could be misused to circumvent

existing safeguards. This allows us to proactively adapt our controls and stay ahead of potential

threats;

 we are committed to transparency. We openly communicate our efforts to combat gender-based

violence and educate users on how to identify and report harmful content. We also empower

users with tools to control their online experience and curate their content feed.



4.3. Risk Management Strategy



In accordance with the defined Risk Assessment Methodology, WGCZ decided to apply the following

risk management strategies based on the residual risk scores:



 Low \- for risk scenarios with a residual score of "Low," the applied strategy is Accept;

this signifies that, after considering the mapped controls and mitigation measures, the remaining

level of risk exposure is considered acceptable. It's important to clarify that "Accept" does not

equate to inaction. Instead, it reflects a well-informed decision based on a robust control

environment. This environment is designed to continuously monitor and evaluate the

effectiveness of these controls. Should any weaknesses or changes in the risk landscape be

identified, the control environment would trigger a prompt response. This could involve

implementing additional controls, enhancing existing controls, or even reassessing the risk

strategy if necessary. In essence, by accepting low residual risk, we acknowledge that the

current controls are sufficient, but we remain vigilant and prepared to adapt should

circumstances change. This ongoing monitoring and management process ensures the

continued effectiveness of our controls and the continued acceptability of our residual risk

exposure.



 Medium or High - for risks with a residual score of "Medium" or "High," the applied strategy

is Reduce (Mitigate); this requires design, development, implementation, and management of

additional measures and controls to effectively address these higher-risk scenarios



4.4. Action plan for each medium – high risk



Following the identification and assessment of risks, this chapter outlines the action plan for mitigating

those risks. The action plan details the specific controls and measures currently in place, as well as

additional mitigation strategies planned for implementation. The focus is on addressing risks with

a residual score of "Medium" or "High" as identified in the residual risk assessment (Chapter 4.3).

WGCZ_Risk Assessment Report 16



The action plan outlined in this chapter provides a comprehensive roadmap for mitigating the identified

risks with a residual score of "Medium" or "High." By implementing the additional mitigation measures

alongside existing controls, WGCZ aims to significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of these risks.



The timeline for implementing the suggested additional measures is targeted for the second and third

quarters of 2024 (Q2 \& Q3 2024). Currently, the specific roles and responsibilities for each mitigation

measure are being defined. Overall oversight will be attributed to the Compliance Officer, who will be

responsible for liaising with relevant teams and ensuring progress on implementation. Management will

be actively involved in the sound management of the systemic risks identified above and will convene

to review the status of the action plan no later than June 30, 2024, to assess progress and address any

potential roadblocks.



The ongoing monitoring and effectiveness of these mitigation measures will be crucial in ensuring

WGCZ's continued compliance with regulations and its commitment to a safe and responsible online

platform.



4.5. Risk monitoring and reporting procedures



Effective risk management requires a continuous process of monitoring and reporting. This chapter

outlines the procedures in place to ensure timely identification and escalation of emerging risks, as well

as regular communication of risk management activities.



The risk monitoring process will be conducted through a combination of ongoing activities and periodic

reviews. Ongoing activities include:



 staying informed of industry trends and developments that may introduce new or exacerbate

existing risks,



 regularly reviewing internal data and reports to identify potential risk indicators,



 monitoring regulatory changes and updates that might impact the risk landscape for WGCZ,



 encouraging a culture of risk awareness within the organization, where employees are

empowered to report any concerns or potential risks they encounter.



Periodic reviews will be conducted as mentioned above – current periodicity is set to quarterly

management reviews given the urgency and regulatory framework development. These reviews will

involve a comprehensive assessment of the risk register, considering any changes in the risk landscape,

the effectiveness of existing and newly implemented measures and controls, and the need for potential

updates to the risk management strategy.

WGCZ_Risk Assessment Report 17



5\. Conclusion



This report has comprehensively described the risk landscape for WGCZ in accordance with the Digital

Services Act (DSA) and best practices in risk management.



5.1. Highlights



Identified Risks



A total of 38 risk scenarios were identified across eight risk categories. The inherent risk assessment

indicated that the majority of these scenarios fall within the medium risk category, with only one classified

as high risk.



Effectiveness of Controls



The existing control environment demonstrates effectiveness in mitigating the majority of identified risks.

The residual risk assessment revealed only four scenarios with a score above "Low," highlighting the

overall robustness of current controls.



Focus Areas



While the initial assessment indicates a well-controlled environment, further focus should be directed

towards specific areas within each risk category. These areas are detailed in the action plan (see above).



5.2. Overall risk profile and control effectiveness



WGCZ exhibits a well-managed risk environment. The inherent risk assessment provided valuable

insights into potential threats, and the effectiveness of existing controls significantly reduces the

likelihood and impact of those risks. However, a proactive approach to risk management necessitates

continuous monitoring and improvement.



5.3. Improvement insights



This report recommends ongoing efforts to strengthen the risk management framework and further

enhance the internal control environment:



Staying ahead of the regulatory curve



The newly established Compliance Office should actively monitor developments in online safety

regulations, particularly those related to the DSA and its potential revisions. Implementing a system for

timely updates to the risk management framework based on these regulatory changes will ensure

ongoing compliance.



Further enhancing online safety awareness



WGCZ will further its commitment to online safety by joining initiatives that raise awareness among

users, especially minors and their guardians. This could involve collaborating with NGOs specializing in

online safety to develop educational materials and campaigns. Additionally, consider expanding the

existing resources for parents and guardians, offering clear and comprehensive guidance on how to

safeguard their children in the online environment.
