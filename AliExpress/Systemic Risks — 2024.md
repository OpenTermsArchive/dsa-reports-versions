I. Executive Summary



Launched in 2010, AliExpress (hereinafter referred to also as “we”, the “Platform”, “us” or “our”) is a

business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce platform enabling global consumers to buy directly from

manufacturers and distributors in China and around the world. AliExpress enables users from over 100

countries and regions to access an extensive range of quality products at competitive prices. From

apparel and electronics to jewellery, watches, home goods, furniture, and health \& beauty products,

the Platform caters to diverse shopping needs. With a vision to empower our customers, our mission

underscores a commitment to enabling a life of choice and to promoting 'Smarter Shopping, Better

Living'. At AliExpress, we value the safety of our users, and have developed terms and conditions as

well as policies, echoing the principles of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.



In line with the obligation laid out in the Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 (the Digital Services Act, or “DSA”),

and following AliExpress’ designation by the European Commission as a Very Large Online Platform

(“VLOP”) in 2023 (“Year 1”), we conducted our first inaugural systemic risk assessment. This year

(“Year 2”), we have built on the baseline set in Year 1 and taken a number of steps to enhance our

approach in the assessment of risks and effectiveness of our mitigation measures.



In Year 2 we refined our methodology in several areas, including around our assessment of probability

and severity to more accurately capture the systemic risks and how they can stem from the design or

functioning of our services, algorithmic system or from the use made of our services by sellers and

buyers. We have also updated our assessment of mitigation effectiveness based on the Digital Trust

and Safety Partnership (DTSP) Safe Assessments Methodology, where an overall mitigation

effectiveness score was computed based on the maturity scores assigned to each assessment

response.



We conducted this assessment supported by our strong risk governance structures, including the DSA

Compliance Function, the Legal \& Compliance Department, the Chief Risk Office (“CRO”), the Platform

Rules Department, the Internal Control Department, our Global IP Enforcement Team, and Emergency

Service Unit (“ESU”) and consulted with key internal and external stakeholders and subject matter

experts.



The current assessment captures the four systemic risk categories outlined in Article 34(1) and

analyses them through five separate modules focusing on the risks that are specific to our services: (i)

Prohibited and Controlled Products (“P\&C”), (ii) Intellectual Property Rights (“IPR”), (iii) Content

Compliance, (iv) Data Protection and (v) Consumer Protection and Related Fundamental Rights.



We assessed a total of two modules with “High” inherent risk rating and none with a “High” residual

risk rating after the mitigation effectiveness was considered. Specifically, P\&C and Consumer

Protection and Related Fundamental Rights modules were assessed to be of “High” inherent risk due

to the high severity and high risk probability. For the P\&C module, the “High” inherent risk was

comparable to the Year 1 Risk Assessment, while for the Consumer Protection and Related

Fundamental Rights module, the inherent risk rating in Year 2 was higher than Year 1 due to updates

to the risk scoring methodology. For the IPR module, the inherent risk rating was assessed to be

Non-Confidential version

“Medium High” and the residual risk rating was assessed to be “Low Medium”, which is similar to Year

1\. For the Content Compliance module, the inherent risk rating was assessed to be “Low Medium” and

the residual risk rating was assessed to be “Low”, which is also similar to Year 1. Lastly, for the Data

Protection module, the inherent risk rating was assessed to be “Medium High” and the residual risk

rating was assessed to be “Low Medium”, which is lower than Year 1. Overall, the reduction in inherent

risk profile was due to the robust risk mitigations including progress made on developing new

mitigations and improvements to existing mitigation measures in Year 2.



In light of the residual risks identified, we plan to further implement, in the upcoming year,

improvements to strengthen our ability to detect, prevent and mitigate these risks. This will include (i)

optimising our algorithmic controls, (ii) expanding reactive reporting channels, (iii) increasing penalties

for severe violations and repeated offenders, (iv) improving support for users and right-holders and

(v) deepening collaboration with external partners. These mitigation strategies will further evolve our

existing set of reasonable, proportionate and effective controls that collectively seek to address the

dynamic risk landscape in which our services operate.



These efforts continue to contribute to our goal of enabling a safe and secure experience where sellers

can offer, and buyers can benefit from, access to a diverse range of products knowing that their safety

and privacy is our top priority. We look forward to continuing these annual assessments and welcome

feedback on our approach from the Commission, researchers and civil society.

II. Introduction



Building on the foundational work established in the first risk assessment under the European Union

(“EU”) Digital Services Act conducted in 2023 (Year 1), AliExpress hereby summarises the results of its

second DSA risk assessment for Year 2, which has been prepared based on data covering the period

starting from 1 July 2023 (i.e., the date falling immediately after the end of Year 1 risk assessment)

until 30 June 2024 (both inclusive). The time frame ensures a comprehensive coverage of Year 2 and

allows for sufficient time for the extraction and analysis of the data in order to conduct this risk

assessment. This Report (the “Report”) reflects AliExpress’ commitment to continuous improvement

in identifying and mitigating systemic risks stemming from the design or functioning of our services in

the EU and to ensure that the Platform remains a safe, trustworthy marketplace for users in the EU.



AliExpress provides an “information society service”, as defined under the EU E-Commerce Directive

(Directive (EU) 2015/1535). Specifically, in DSA terms, AliExpress operates an online platform that

allows consumers to conclude distance contracts with traders. Since its launch in 2010 as a business-

to-consumer online marketplace, AliExpress has enabled business sellers and consumers to share

product listings, exchange product information, and complete transactions. The seller bears the

obligations related to the sales agreements, including storing, delivery and after-sales, while

AliExpress provides customer service and support for buyer-seller disputes.



The Year 1 Risk Assessment set a strong baseline for identifying and mitigating the risks stemming

from the design or functioning of the Platform. Taking into account new literature, industry best

practices and initial regulatory feedback, AliExpress has built on the reflections and learnings from

Year 1 to allow for a more nuanced analysis in Year 2. Concretely, the following changes were made

between the Year 1 and Year 2:



● Methodology: We have updated our methodology for Year 2 by streamlining our assessment

of certain sub-categories of related risks. We have refined the risk assessment questionnaires

to align more closely with Article 34(2) of the DSA and also enhanced our scoring methodology

to allow for a more granular evaluation of systemic risks.

● Platform Environment: We have given specific attention to the changes on the Platform

between Year 1 and Year 2 and assessed their impacts on the systemic risks, including those

stemming from new features or the growing relevance of certain business models.



In conducting this assessment, we have rigorously identified the risks that may materialise through

the design or functioning of AliExpress in the EU; analysed the effectiveness of our existing controls;

identified potential areas for improvement; and considered targeted mitigation strategies to address

residual risks.



As laid out under Article 34(3) of the DSA, the relevant supporting documentation and data used for

the assessment have been preserved in a separate internal repository to allow us to monitor the

evolution of the risks over time, track the progress of our mitigation measures, and allow for

continuous improvements to our methodology over time.

Our Year 2 Risk Assessment not only reinforces our dedication to comply with the DSA but also

underscores our proactive approach to navigating the complexities of operating a digital marketplace.

As we move forward, AliExpress remains steadfast in our commitment to upholding the highest

standards of safety, security, and user trust while protecting their fundamental rights.

III. Consultations with Stakeholders



To meet due diligence requirements, we have sought input and guidance from suitably qualified

subject matter experts, including feedback from the European Commission, other national and

regional authorities from EU member states, specialised consultants and other stakeholders. We have

sought their knowledge and expertise where necessary to comprehensively assess the systemic risks

stemming from the design and functioning of our services and get their insights around any emergent

areas of concern, allowing us to refine our approach to stay ahead of potential future risks.



The Year 2 systemic risk assessment exercise has also involved a number of AliExpress internal teams,

including representatives from CRO, Legal \& Compliance, Government Affairs, Internal Control,

Product Design, Tech, Finance, Marketing, Europe Country Business, Global IP Enforcement, and the

Customer Service teams among others. This has enabled us to conduct the assessment based on the

most accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date information across the entire company. Given the

importance of this exercise, the business group in which AliExpress is integrated, Alibaba International

Digital Commerce (AIDC), also contributed resources and insights from its Legal \& Compliance and

CRO functions.



To enhance our risk management and compliance capabilities further, we regularly invite external

agencies, such as the British Standards Institution (BSI), to annually audit key certifications, including

ISO 27001/27701 for information security and privacy management and PCI-DSS for payment security,

demonstrating our commitment to adhere to privacy protection laws, regulatory standards and best

practices.



In addition to these certifications, we partner with leading compliance service providers to enhance

our detection, prevention and enforcement strategies across high-risk areas for content and products

on the Platform. These collaborations enable us to leverage expert insights and advanced tools to

monitor external channels, conduct analyses of product listings, identify trends in fraudulent

behaviour, and monitor merchant activities across various markets, to further strengthen the

Platform’s defences against fraud and unauthorised activities.

IV. Risk Governance Framework



To comply with Article 41(1) of the DSA, following AliExpress’ designation as a VLOP, the European

Legal \& Compliance team and the European Risk Management team focus on the European region

under the coordination of the DSA Compliance Function established in compliance with the DSA.



There are specialist teams within the Legal \& Compliance team and/or the Chief Risk Office who are

each responsible for a specific function (e.g., Prohibited \& Restricted, IPR, etc.), this specialised

functional team will take the lead in addressing concerns that may arise in these areas, while the

European Legal Team and/or the European CRO team remain involved in issues that pertain to or

impacts EU DSA compliance. In cases where there is no dedicated functional team and the matter

relates to DSA compliance or impacts DSA compliance, the European Legal Team and/or European

CRO team take the lead, involving other teams as appropriate under the coordination of the DSA

Compliance Function.



The European Legal Team and the European CRO team are at the heart of the DSA Task Force, jointly

leading the implementation of AliExpress's DSA compliance efforts and continuing to provide support

in collaboration with other functional teams from Legal \& Compliance, CRO, or other areas (e.g., the

Platform rule department, Product Design, Tech, etc.).



Specifically, to ensure the Platform remains compliant with the DSA's requirements, the European

Legal Team and the European CRO Team will regularly monitor and prepare periodic DSA Compliance

Reports under the coordination of the DSA Compliance Function. The reports will be sent and/or

presented to AliExpress management body by the Head of the AliExpress Compliance Function in

meetings, covering relevant DSA compliance matters (e.g., activities related to independent audits,

risk mitigation measures, risk strategies and policies, risk assessment plans, compliance data

monitoring, etc.).



An overview of the core functions involved in DSA compliance matters is provided below:



■ The DSA Compliance Function is independent from the Platform’s operational functions and

holds the necessary authority and resources to both investigate and address compliance

concerns. The contact details of the Head of the Compliance Function were also informally

communicated in 2023 to the ACM, which this year was subsequently designated by the

Netherlands as its Digital Services Coordinator. In January 2024, AliExpress International

(Netherlands) B.V. (“AliExpress Netherlands”) took over from Alibaba (Netherlands) B.V. as

our EU establishment for DSA purposes, i.e., the Platform’s EU establishment remains based

in the Netherlands. This change was communicated in a timely manner to the European

Commission and the ACM.

■ The Legal \& Compliance Department monitors legal requirements globally, identifies shifts

in regulations, and converts legal provisions into guidelines that can be effectively

implemented on the Platform. The Europe Legal \& Compliance team focuses on the

European region, including DSA matters.

Non-Confidential version

■ The CRO verifies that products meet the required standards and certifications, oversees the

content compliance adherence, and ensures regulatory compliance through relevant tools

and processes. Within the CRO, the Europe Risk Management team (under the Business Risk

Management department) is the core team responsible for DSA compliance. The CRO creates

and enforces standardised operating procedures (“SOPs”) for reviewing products, conducts

manual and automated assessments, and takes action against violating products. We provide

avenues for appeals and user reports, with dedicated teams tasked with verifying and

responding to such cases. Regarding the DSA systemic risk assessment process, the DSA

Compliance Function, with the support of the Europe Legal \& Compliance and the Europe

Risk Management teams, evaluates the risk assessment modules, mitigation plans, and the

implementation of mitigations. The DSA Compliance Function reports periodically to the

Board of Alibaba.com Singapore E-commerce Private Limited (i.e., AliExpress service

provider, but also to the board of our EU establishment, AliExpress Netherlands), who

oversees the overall implementation of AliExpress’ DSA commitments.

■ The Platform Rules Department formulates and enforces platform rules and policies

governing sellers' product listings, information dissemination, and seller education,

integrating insights from legal interpretations and understanding the unique characteristics

of e-commerce. The team also designs punitive measures for violations, encompassing

actions such as content removal, point deductions, and permission restrictions.

■ The Internal Control Department provides internal inspection and control support regarding

the procedures and tools in place to comply with different legal requirements and company

policies.

■ Crisis Management: AliExpress operates a special cross-departmental Emergency Service

Unit (ESU) to standardise the management of public emergencies, improve the ability to deal

with public incidents and formulate a scientific, effective and responsive emergency service

mechanism. The members of this unit include CRO, Customer Chief Office (CCO), Legal \&

Compliance, Public Relations and technology representatives. We have a robust crisis control

process in place to classify risk types within technical security, data compliance, commodity

safety, loss of funds, regulatory directives and public opinion, and also to classify risk levels

from E4 to E1 with corresponding step-by-step alarm and treatment measures.

V. Risk Assessment Methodology



The Year 2 Risk Assessment exercise, as summarised in this Report, reflects the risk profile of our

services as of 30 June 2024. In compliance with Article 34 DSA, AliExpress’ systemic risk assessment

methodology evaluates how the Platform may contribute to systemic risks in the EU, as outlined in

Article 34(1). The assessment has taken into account the relevant recitals of the DSA, i.e., 12, 79, 80,

81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 89, and 90 and covers the four categories of systemic risks, notably:



1. the dissemination of illegal content through our services;

2. any actual and foreseeable negative effects to the exercise of fundamental rights;

3. any actual or foreseeable negative effects in relation to civic discourse, electoral processes,

public security; and,

4. any actual or foreseeable negative effects in relation to gender-based violence, the protection

of public health and minors and serious negative consequences to the person’s physical and

mental well-being.



As part of our ongoing risk management efforts, we have refined and streamlined our Year 1

methodology in Year 2, drawing our updates from new literature and industry best practices (including

considerations made in the DTSP Safe Assessments Methodology 1 and the EUCRA Report 2 ).

Specifically, we have updated our risk register to streamline our analysis and more closely align with

the specific systemic risks that can materialise from the design or functioning of AliExpress as per

Article 34(1). Additionally, we have redesigned the risk assessment questionnaires to align more

closely with Article 34(2) of the DSA in order to conduct a more comprehensive analysis of the key

features and related systems in the Platform that may influence the systemic risks. Finally, we also

enhanced our risk scoring methodology to allow for a more granular evaluation of the inherent risks,

mitigation effectiveness and the residual risk scores, with the aim to more accurately reflect the extent

of risks and AliExpress’ control measures on the Platform.



Similar to Year 1, we have followed a four-phase approach to identify, analyse, and assess any systemic

risk stemming from the design or functioning of AliExpress and its related systems, including

algorithmic systems, or from the usage of our services. Figure 1 provides an overview of the

assessment methodology, with detailed updates for the 4 phases in Year 2 Risk Assessment Process

outlined below:

Figure 1: Overview of the risk assessment methodology



Phase I: Identification of Systemic Risks



In Year 2, we maintained the five risk modules based on the four systemic risk categories outlined in

Article 34(1), but with some changes to the classification of certain risk sub-categories within certain

modules.



To streamline the assessment process, we have adopted a more holistic approach by evaluating

related sub-categories of systemic risks together. This aligns our methodology more closely with the

requirements of Article 34(1) of the DSA, which mandates that risk assessments be specific to the

service. By doing so, we (i) ensure consistency with the Transparency Reporting Statement of Reason

(SoR) categories; (ii) better capture the intended use of AliExpress as an online marketplace; and (iii)

address the specific risks associated with the functioning of such a service. Table 1 summarises the

updated risk registry used for the Year 2 Risk Assessment.

Phase II: Assessing Inherent Risks



Similar to Year 1, the inherent risks assessment involved analysing the risks arising from the features,

design, functionality of the Platform and its related systems (including algorithmic systems) in a

hypothetical scenario, as if there were no controls in place. We have updated the risk assessment

questionnaires for each of the five risk modules, which allows for a more consistent, in depth, and

systematic assessment of the key features outlined in Article 34(2), including the design of the

recommender system, the content moderation systems, applicable terms and conditions and their

enforcement, advertisement systems and data related practices. The assessment also considers how

the identified risks were influenced by inauthentic and misuse of our services, along with the specific

regional or linguistic aspects of the different EU member states.



As defined in Article 34(1), the inherent risk level takes into consideration (1) the probability of the

risk occurring, and (2) the severity of the risk.



Probability

The probability of risk occurring is calculated by taking into consideration (i) the number of times a

particular type of risk occurred over the assessed period and (ii) comparing it to the weight it

represents on the total volume of a specific category of business operations run on AliExpress within

a given statistical cycle. As much as possible, we have aligned the probability calculation with the

metrics published in our transparency reports to ensure consistency. The data period is therefore from

1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024 to align the transparency reporting with the Risk Assessment.3



As no data can truly measure the probability of a risk occurring without controls in place, given that

this is a hypothetical scenario we used the closest proxy we have to estimate the potential probability

of the risk materialising on our services. In Year 2, we have used the same probability thresholds as in

Year 1 to maintain consistency and comparability4.



Severity

In Year 2, we enhanced our approach to assessing the potential severity of the inherent risks to align

more closely with emerging best practices in the space by updating our questionnaires, and supporting

them with data quantifications. The severity questionnaire was developed based on the UN Guiding

Principles on Business and Human Rights framework5, which highlights the following characteristics as

impacting the severity of the risks:

1. Scope (the number of individuals that are or could be affected);

2. Scale (gravity of the impact on the human right(s)) and



3 Please note that, for technical reasons, in some situations the data may not be available for the full period, in

which case, we have brought in what data we have available, and highlighted the time period it covers.

4 See Annex 1 for more details on the scoring.

Non-Confidential version



15



3. Remediability (the ease with which those impacted could be restored to their prior enjoyment

of the right(s)).



For each risk module, an overall severity score was computed based on the holistic assessment of the

three severity characteristics above. Scores range from 1 (Very Low) to 5 (Very High), and reflect the

potential impact of the identified risks, considering both the extent and range of harm as well as the

ease of recovery (Annex 2 for more details on the scoring).



Inherent Risk Score

Similar to Year 1, the inherent risk score was derived by plotting the probability of occurrence and

potential severity of impact on users in a matrix6 . The inherent risk scores7 range from “High,”

indicating a high likelihood of occurrence with significant negative consequences, to “Low,” where the

occurrence is very rare and the impact is minimal.



Note: The purpose of this approach is to enable readers to evaluate and comprehend the risks in terms

that are more concrete and accessible. These assessments are constructed from a combination of

quantitative and qualitative evaluations, and it is essential that they be interpreted within this context.

Nevertheless, we are confident that these assessments serve as a meaningful illustration of the

relevant risks, providing a well-rounded perspective that reflects both numerical analysis and nuanced

understanding.



Phase III: Assessing Mitigation Measures Effectiveness



After assessing the inherent risks, the next step involved measuring the effectiveness of the existing

mitigating measures. In Year 2, the overall mitigation effectiveness score was updated to a 5-scale

scoring (from a 3-scale scoring in Year 1) to provide greater granularity and better reflect the

effectiveness of the mitigation measures implemented. A structured questionnaire was created to

determine the maturity levels of each mitigation measure based on industry best practices in line with

the DTSP Safe Assessments Methodology, which is among the most developed and recognised in the

online trust and safety industry. An overall mitigation effectiveness score was computed based on the

maturity scores assigned to each assessment response.



Phase IV: Assessing and Addressing Residual Risks



After assessing both the inherent risks associated with our services and the effectiveness of the

existing risk mitigation measures, we mapped the inherent risk scores to the mitigation effectiveness

scores8 to obtain the residual risk score9 for each of the five risk modules. This process enabled us to

9 See Annex 5 for more details on the scoring.

evaluate the remaining level of concern regarding the likelihood and impact of risks to users on the

Platform after mitigations have been applied.



However, despite our best efforts, certain risks stemming from the designing and functioning of our

services may remain. In fact, a level of residual risks is inevitable given that the nature of the risks

faced are in constant evolution. In response to this, a continuous risk-based monitoring and

enforcement mechanism has been implemented in place to identify and respond to these evolving

risks on AliExpress.



Similar to Year 1, in accordance with Article 35 of the DSA, we considered where existing mitigation

measures could be adjusted and where additional measures could be implemented to further reduce

residual risks and respond to the emerging risks related to our user community or business

developments. In Year 2 we have incorporated our discussion of residual risk mitigation roadmap

within each of the risk modules for greater coherence with our risk assessment and alignment with

Article 35(1) of the DSA. For example, we have mapped our mitigation roadmap with the 11 categories

of mitigation measures under Article 35(1), where applicable.

VI. Summary of the Platform Environment



Systemic risks on AliExpress can be best understood by examining the core components of the

Platform’s environment. As an online marketplace, AliExpress primarily facilitates transactions

between buyers and sellers. Therefore, certain elements, such as the increase in user numbers, the

expansion of local sellers and their product assortments to cover more EU countries, and the growing

complexity of our services contribute to a dynamic platform landscape. As AliExpress continues to gain

popularity, it may unfortunately attract “bad actors”, or fraudulent buyers or sellers who may innovate

new product control and content moderation evasion tactics, further complicating our risk

environment.



The factors highlighted in Article 34(2) of the DSA are integral to the Platform’s overall functioning and

frequently reappear across various risk assessment modules. Additionally, we have included elements

and features outside of Article 34(2) that we believe are important to explain in order to provide a

more comprehensive understanding of the Platform environment. These include:



● Platform design and functionalities: As an online marketplace, the main risk vector on

AliExpress is linked to the ability to post product listings that allow buyers and sellers to

conclude distance contracts. Some listings may contain illegal or controlled products (analysed

in the Prohibited \& Controlled Products, “P\&C”, Module) or IPR-infringing goods (IPR Module).

Other Platform functionalities may also contribute to systemic risks. For instance, instant

messaging (“IM”) may be misused to discuss the sale of prohibited and controlled items

(“P\&C”) or IPR-infringing goods. Users may also use IM, comments or reviews to share

violating content, such as discriminatory or hateful language (see Content Compliance

Module). Similarly, delivering an ordered product requires giving sellers some level of access

to buyers’ data which, in the absence of any controls, may lead to data protection risks (see

Data Protection Module).

● Inauthentic use: The Platform additionally faces risks related to inauthentic use of the

Platform's functionalities. These actions can undermine the trustworthiness of the

marketplace, mislead genuine buyers, and distort the perceived quality or legitimacy of

products, leading to systemic risks for the Platform’s integrity and user experience.

● Advertising systems: The only type of users that can place advertisements on AliExpress are

sellers, which may choose to place ads in search and/or recommendation scenarios. By setting

factors such as the delivery country and application bid, the recommender system uses

inferred parameters (such as previous shopping history or interests, age, gender, purchasing

amounts, etc.) to facilitate more accurate matching between sellers and potential buyers.

Based on the AliExpress's advertising bidding mechanism and the profiling techniques of the

recommender system, sellers can pay a premium to obtain greater probability of reaching

specific groups of people. Before purchasing advertising services, sellers agree to our

advertising policies. Additionally, the showing of adverts occurs downstream from product

control at the product listing and display stage, therefore any product that has been blocked

from publication cannot be advertised. The Platform also applies proactive controls to detect

non-compliant ads before they are displayed. However, there remains a risk that illegal

Non-Confidential version



18



products (P\&C and IPR) may be shared on the Platform (whether as advertisements or

otherwise).

● Recommender system: We use a single recommender system across the entire Platform with

different product ranking logics for the different scenarios where information is displayed. As

indicated in AliExpress’ Terms and Conditions, the main parameters used for

recommendations are inferred from the user’s profile: location, search history, shopping

behaviour and member profile information (such as age, city, interests, purchased amount).

Additionally, the recommendation pool is directly connected to the database of sensitive

product content (such as Halloween-related horror elements that are not suitable for

proactive recommendations), therefore any products with content found in that database will

be automatically excluded from the recommendation pool, in order to safeguard users’

experiences with the recommendation system on the Platform.

● Data and content moderation systems: AliExpress’ systems span technology, people, and

processes. Content moderation on the Platform is managed through the internal risk

management system (“MTEE”). MTEE provides the backbone for our proactive detection

algorithms (text-based, image-based and combined indicators) and manual review and audit

teams (including the CRO, specialised product teams, and trained moderation staff).

● Applicable policies: We have a wide range of policies that users agree to when joining the

Platform, which guide manual and automated enforcement. Our policies are necessarily

dynamic, adapting to new risk vectors and emerging regulations.

● Regional and linguistic diversity: 99% of product-related content on the Platform is published

in English. Non-English language content by sellers is automatically translated to English for

algorithmic identification, while non-text-based systems are capable of identifying

problematic listings regardless of language.

● Choice service: during this year our “Choice” service has gained in popularity, in which

AliExpress provides additional supply chain and other value-added services to sellers,

shortening the supply chain so it can offer better value for money to buyers and simplified

operations for sellers. While the exact scope of “Choice” is still under experimentation, it

basically involves certain operational aspects, such as customer acquisition, product listing,

logistics or after-sales services.

● Affiliate program: AliExpress users with a buyer account can apply to become a participant of

the Affiliate Program in order to derive commission revenue from the promotion of products

outside AliExpress as an affiliate.

● Off-Platform risks: In light of the success of our internal moderation tools, certain sellers have

attempted to bypass controls by resorting to off-platform means, such as using hidden links,

which originate on social media sites, standalone websites, chat applications, and search

engines.

VII. Prohibited and Controlled Products



I. Risk Definition



In the Prohibited and Controlled module, we analysed the risk(s) that the design or functioning of the

Platform and its related systems (including algorithmics systems) may be used to disseminate, or

contribute to disseminating P\&C products. Prohibited products refer to items that are not allowed to

be listed and sold on the marketplace as stipulated by a governing body within its jurisdiction.

Meanwhile, controlled products refer to items that are restricted and should meet relevant

qualification requirements due to safety concerns or are subject to controlled selling or posting

regulations, or other requirements, in accordance with the laws of relevant jurisdictions. For example,

an item may need to meet special requirements such as producer licensing, labelling standards, or

product certifications (as the case may be) in order to be listed and sold on the marketplace.



In this regard, our assessment of this module takes reference from applicable EU laws, including the

recently passed Regulation 2023/988 on general product safety, and focuses on the risk of

disseminating illegal products, as outlined in Article 34(1)(a) of the DSA, including:



● The sale of non-compliant products.

● The dissemination of dangerous products that pose a threat to public security.



In certain cases, the sale of products on the Platform could result in negative effects to Fundamental

Rights laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (2000/C364/1) (“the EU

Charter”). For example, certain products may infringe on the integrity of the person. As the risk of

negative effects to fundamental rights arises from the risk of dissemination of prohibited products,

controls that apply to curbing P\&C products being sold also serve to mitigate such risks to fundamental

rights. As such, we have assessed those relevant fundamental rights as part of the overall P\&C

products module.



II. Inherent Risk



Given the dynamic nature of the risk and the high volume of sellers attempting to list prohibited and

non-compliant controlled products, AliExpress has conducted a more in-depth analysis in Year 2,

building upon the baseline of the risks identified in Year 1. This analysis focuses on how various

Platform features and factors, including those outlined in Article 34(2)(a) of the DSA, contribute to this

risk.



a. Risks from Platform Design and Functionalities, including their misuse



AliExpress acts as a marketplace to facilitate transactions between sellers and buyers on the Platform.

The most common functionality used by sellers which may create or contribute to the risk of the

dissemination of P\&C products on the Platform is to attempt to publish, list and sell P\&C items. The

functionalities of publishing products include uploading and publishing text, photo and video content

Non-Confidential version



20



in the form of full product listings, product pictures and videos, product titles and descriptions as well

as reviews and hyperlinks that may enable off-Platform purchasing behaviour. Often, the illegal

information will be included in either the title of the product, main pictures or videos, product

specification (brand, certification, model number, etc.) and product description (text or pictures).



Sellers may also misuse the Platform functionalities to publish and sell P\&C products through the

following ways:



● Misrepresentation of product details: [Confidential].

● Falsification of qualification documents: Sellers in categories requiring compliance

qualifications must upload documentation such as product compliance certificates, test

reports and/or product packaging label pictures when listing controlled products.

[Confidential].

● Misplaced product categories: We have strict category governance controls for certain

product categories that require specific qualifications as mentioned above. [Confidential].



In addition to functionalities which allow users to list and publish products, there are other functions

that may be used to distribute P\&C products that have been published on AliExpress (such as IM, Buyer

Question \& Answers, Order Details, Feed - a stream of content that you can scroll through with short

video - Livestream, Reviews and the Affiliate Program). As these functionalities are closely linked to

the risk of disseminating illegal content (e.g., hate speech, pornography, violent content etc.) on the

Platform, details about these functionalities are discussed more comprehensively in the Content

Compliance and IPR modules.



The sale and purchase of P\&C products on the Platform can result in potentially significant harm,

including physical injury, psychological distress, and financial loss for those affected. This is a serious

concern for all users.



However, there is an additional risk related to minors. Although AliExpress is intended solely for adult

use, minors might still access the Platform [Confidential – bypassing the mechanisms of control]. This

exposes them to products that are inappropriate or unsafe for their age, potentially leading to further

harm.



In Year 2, we identified that the expansion of the AliExpress services to sellers from additional EU

countries (e.g., in Poland and Germany) may theoretically contribute to the increased risk of

disseminating P\&C products on the Platform in general, as would every expansion of services to new

regions. However, considering that sellers from the EU are more likely to offer products that are

already compliant with local regulations, the expansion of a more likely compliant product pool could,

in fact, reduce the likelihood of P\&C products reaching EU consumers.



b. Risks from Other Factors of the Platform (in line with Article 34(2) of the DSA)



Both in Year 1 and Year 2, we have assessed how the factors listed in Article 34(2) of the DSA may

influence the risks of disseminating P\&C products. Please refer to Section VI for more context on these

factors.

Non-Confidential version



21



● Advertising systems and data practices: There is a risk that sellers manage to successfully

publish P\&C products on AliExpress and advertise them on the Platform if our product

compliance controls or advertising controls do not detect and remove the products before

they are being advertised. While it is not possible to assess the full scale of this risk, the

historical volume of detected infringements can serve as a proxy for this particular risk. Among

the products removed by the Platform due to violations of P\&C product rules in the time

period from 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024, 6% of them ([Confidential]) were advertised.

● Recommender system: If sellers manage to evade our proactive product compliance controls

and publish their P\&C products, there is a risk that such products may be recommended to

users through our recommender system. While it is not possible to assess the full scale of this

risk, the historical volume of detected infringements can serve as a proxy for this particular

risk. Among the products removed by the Platform due to violations of P\&C product rules in

the time period from 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024, a total of 14,746,471 P\&C products were

recommended by our recommender system in the EU.

● Relevant policies: As legislation gets updated in various countries, our P\&C Product Listing

Policy and related platform rules could become outdated and would need to be continuously

iterated upon. Inaccurate policy enforcement (such as due to technology system failure and

human errors) could also contribute to this risk. While it is not possible to assess the full scale

of this risk, the number of P\&C product policies and guidelines that have been updated can

serve as a proxy for this particular risk. Between 1 July 2023 and 30 June 2024, 274 policies

and guidelines around P\&C products were updated to ensure applicability.

● Content moderation systems and product compliance controls: Our content moderation

systems and product compliance controls are designed to reduce risks of disseminating P\&C

products. However, certain P\&C products could fail to be identified by either algorithmic

detection systems (e.g., new and evolving risks that the algorithms have not been sufficiently

trained on, detection system failures and downtime) or be missed by the human reviewers.

The review process could also not be able to deal with the identified illegal products quickly

enough. While it is not possible to assess the full scale of this risk, the historical volume of P\&C

products that were blocked due to reactive reports can serve as a proxy for this particular risk.

Between 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024, a total of 10,737 P\&C products were blocked due to

reactive reports. This figure represents 0.05% of all P\&C products removed from the Platform

worldwide during the same period.



Given that AliExpress operates as a marketplace, the potential theoretical risk—assuming no controls

are in place—of dissemination of P\&C products is “High”. While it is not possible to measure the risk

without any controls in place, this risk can be estimated by examining the number of products that

were blocked or removed based on P\&C product rules, and the number of sellers that were removed

for violating rules for P\&C products. Between 1 July 2023 and 30 June 2024, 1,148,061 P\&C items were

removed in the EU and 11,659 sellers were blocked for non-compliance with AliExpress’ rules on P\&C

products. Further, we can also infer that there are not only sellers that are motivated to attempt to

sell P\&C products, but also buyers that are looking to purchase them. This is evident from the blocking

Non-Confidential version



22



of prohibited search terms, which occurred 15,591,798 times worldwide between 27 March 2024 and

30 June 2024 [Confidential].



III. Existing Mitigations



In Year 2, we continued to operate strong control mechanisms and further enhanced our P\&C Product

controls through our Year 1 mitigation commitments and adapting them to address specific events

that could act as P\&C product risk vectors in the EU.



a. Algorithmic Controls



We operate a comprehensive and sophisticated risk identification system to proactively detect the

majority of violating P\&C products before they get published. Meanwhile, we continuously optimise

and upgrade our system capabilities. The risk identification systems leverage artificial intelligence

technology to continuously enhance the detection of illegal products and content on the Platform.

Different algorithmic controls are deployed to analyse text, images and videos uploaded by users to

detect and block P\&C products before they get published. The data collected from the product listings

are screened by our automated systems, which continuously screen listing text and images, using our

own self-developed detection techniques, to determine whether listed products comply with

AliExpress’ product compliance rules. Listings identified by the risk identification system as requiring

review will be forwarded to a dedicated audit team for further manual review. Product listings found

to be in violation are removed and the sellers will be penalised in accordance with the rules stipulated

by our violation penalty points system.



On the Platform, there are features to mitigate the risks of P\&C products such as the following:



● Consumer safety warning: For those product categories that we identified with potential

safety risks, but do not manifestly violate our policies, we have the corresponding consumer

safety warning on the product detail page so that buyers are made aware of the safety

guidance and the potential risks, notwithstanding sellers' obligations in this regard.

● Product certification verification: the Platform's product listing system includes a certificate

upload feature that allows sellers to upload necessary documentation to prove a product's

reliability and compliance. For certain high-risk product categories, sellers are required to

provide these certificates to meet local compliance standards before listing their products.



The covered product scope for these features has been continuously expanding.



b. Internal Risk Identification



There are several teams and external vendors working together to implement and improve the

identification of P\&C Product risks. This includes the monitoring of relevant EU and international laws

and regulations to inform the formulation of detailed rules that can be implemented by the Platform.

Specifically, this entails the development of specific policies for sellers’ product listings in various

Non-Confidential version



23



categories, providing sellers information about P\&C products, conducting seller education and

awareness on policies and establishing certain account restrictions.



Additionally, there are teams responsible for conducting comprehensive management and control of

P\&C items on the Platform, including but not limited to the verification of product qualification

information and the review of product content. If the product does not meet the policy requirements,

the product will be deleted and the seller’s store will be penalised, which may even involve the closure

of such a store. There is also a team dedicated to investigating and taking action against P\&C items

reported by users and detected by AliExpress’ own monitoring of the relevant regulators’ product

recall websites. Affected buyers are supported by AliExpress’ product recall process and given financial

compensation. Between 1 July 2023 and 30 June 2024, around 510,435 products were removed and

recalled and 123,769 sellers were enforced.



In addition to product-level checks, there are also account-level verifications. Sellers are required to

undergo verification to review their qualifications as a trader and funding account information. This

process typically requires sellers to submit business details and licence information, Ultimate

Beneficial Owner and legal representative information, and corporate structure information. Only

sellers who have passed the verification process are permitted to open a store, which is also helpful

to improve the traceability for all products.



In line with DSA Article 20, we provide appeal and service consultation channels for all restrictions of

the services, and a dedicated team is responsible for verifying and processing the appeals or answering

questions through the consultation channel. Between 1 July 2023 and 30 June 2024, we received

62,221 appeals from 20,519,191 products regarding the Platform’s enforcement actions related to P\&C

product risks. Of these appeals, 5,614 were successful. (i.e., enforcement was overturned).



c. External Risk Identification



AliExpress provides various external reporting channels to complement the internal identification of

P\&C product risks. The reporting function of the Platform is provided to multiple types of users, such

as sellers, buyers and Trusted Flaggers (In line with Art. 22(1) of the DSA). Users will be provided with

an acknowledgement of their reports, and once the decisions are made by the Platform (which are all

manually reviewed) users will be informed of the decision. Between 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024, out

of all P\&C products removed on the Platform, 0.05% of them (10,737 products) were blocked due to

reports received from the reporting function of the Platform.



At the same time, the Platform has a designated mailbox (eu.productsafety@aliexpress.com) to

receive reports or orders from competent market surveillance authorities in the EU. Dedicated

personnel have been charged with promptly handling these complaints from these authorities. After

receiving an illegal content report or order from an authority, the illegal products will be taken down

and relevant notifications will be sent to the seller to recall the products when applicable. Meanwhile,

any information about the illegal product will be added to our proactive monitoring system if they are

not already included. Between 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024, we took down 4,733 illegal products

directly reported by EU market surveillance authorities.

Non-Confidential version



24



We also work with external professional service providers to carry out regular monitoring and manual

sampling reviews of the Platform’s product listings targeting EU and other markets across multiple

languages in high risk product categories to look for suspected illegal listings. These vendors provide

regular reports to us to identify latest illegal product risk trends to support our enforcement against

illegal products on the Platform and enhance our corresponding proactive product compliance

controls. Between 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024, our external professional service providers sent a total

of 25,243 listings to AliExpress by means of the periodic reporting indicated above. Of these listings,

5,881 were EU-related and were either removed or had their accessibility restricted to EU users.



To further improve the detection of unsafe products on the Platform, AliExpress, as an original

signatory to the first Product Safety Pledge (in 2018), signed the revamped Product Safety Pledge+ in

March 2023. As a signatory to this Pledge, we undertake voluntary commitments going beyond what

is already established in EU legislation, including those requirements applicable on product safety.



d. Policies and Enforcement



As introduced in our Year 1 report, we have a number of detailed policies and rules regarding P\&C

products. To ensure that these policies remain updated and in view of new regulatory requirements,

we updated the AliExpress Index of P\&C Items in July 2023 and published the AliExpress Compliance

Notice on the EU General Product Safety Regulation (“GPSR”) in June 2024. In addition to specific rules

for relevant product categories, the Platform-wide rules for P\&C products include (but are not limited

to):

● Product Listing Policy.

● Index of P\&C Items.

● AliExpress Compliance Notice on the EU GPSR.



Violations of the Platform policies result in the accumulation of penalty points, which are assigned

based on the severity of the violation. Penalties against accounts are enforced once these points reach

a certain threshold, which depends on the degree of danger or severity of harm involved. General

violations add a strike to a seller’s account, while extreme violations can trigger account removal with

a single strike. This 1-strike policy serves as a deterrent against inauthentic use by users who are

malicious or intent on causing significant damage to the Platform.



To enhance policy compliance, we also conduct external compliance training for sellers (such as

through the Seller Centre, Message Notification or Offline Events like the Seller Summit). Through our

education efforts, we continue to provide product compliance information and knowledge, enhance

sellers' product compliance awareness, and seek to reduce their violations and thereby the risks of

illegal products on the Platform. For instance, more than 12,000 sellers attended our recent online

training for GPSR compliance in August 2024. The training recording also reached 24,000 views as of

30 Aug 2024.

Non-Confidential version



25



e. Minors Protection



As stipulated in our Terms and Conditions, we do not provide services to minors (individuals under the

age of 18), and have specific restrictions on account registration and the use of payment methods.

When users register for an account, they are clearly reminded that they must be 18 years or older.

Additionally, the requirement for valid payment methods acts as a further control mechanism. More

information is included in the Consumer Protection module on this topic.



f. New Mitigation Measures



In line with Year 1 commitments, we have, in the past twelve months, made significant improvements

to the effectiveness of our mitigation measures. Notably:



● Choice service controls: Choice products have stricter controls than normal products because

of the curation of Choice sellers and the screening of products by dedicated AliExpress

business teams. After pre-screening and filtering of sellers and products, Choice products

generally have lower P\&C product risks (along with IPR and non-compliant content risks).

● Choice service product inspections: In addition, under the “Full-Entrustment” model of the

Choice service, most products will need to be placed into an AliExpress-designated warehouse

and will be manually inspected. If a product is detected to have issues (such as P\&C or IPR

related risks), the Platform will arrange to remove the products from the warehouse or charge

for rectification in the warehouse (e.g., adding compliance labels). The full cost of withdrawal

will be borne by the sellers, which is intended to deter them from trying to sell non-compliant

products in the future. Sellers can also be removed for serious product and transaction-related

violations such as the sale of illegal medicines or drugs.

● Enhanced collaboration with professional service providers: We have enhanced the scope of

cooperation with professional third-party service providers to leverage their specialised

expertise in identifying and defining P\&C products in specific risk areas. These providers supply

text and image samples for risk identification, which are then manually reviewed by our staff,

and help detect illegal products for appropriate action.

● Improved our P\&C products violation detection algorithms: We have continuously improved

our P\&C products violation detection algorithms by incorporating a multimodal classification

algorithm, which utilises text and image data to enhance detection capabilities. In September

2023, we updated the Image-to-Image algorithm by enhancing capabilities for similar and

identical product search to increase product control effectiveness. Strengthened algorithmic

product risk controls will help reduce the number of P\&C products entering the advertising

and recommender product pools downstream, thereby mitigating the risk of disseminating

prohibited and controlled products through AliExpress’ advertising and recommender

systems. More details about risk controls for AliExpress’ advertising and recommender

systems are included in Section XI on Consumer Protection and Related Fundamental Rights.

● Enhanced recall process: We voluntarily identify and recall P\&C products to mitigate P\&C risks.

Additionally, since September 2023, AliExpress has enhanced the recall process for illegal

products to actively improve support to users who had purchased these products. Specifically,

Non-Confidential version



26



we have expanded the scope of the recalled products to include recalls demanded by

concerned producers and by local regulators. For certain high risk products, users can receive

product recall notice through multiple channels, including email, APP push, APP Message

Centre and information published on the AliExpress Recall website, and directly initiate the

option of "refund only” without having to return the product, which makes the procedure

easier for users.

● Restrictions on repeat violators: We have also introduced more severe restrictions for sellers

who have repeated violations, such as by raising the penalty points imposed for each violation

or by imposing penalty points for infractions that were previously not punished by penalty

points.



IV. Residual Risk



Despite our best efforts in mitigating the risk of P\&C products on the Platform through proactive and

reactive measures, we cannot fully eliminate the risks entirely due to the dynamic nature of the risk

landscape, where new illegal products may arise and malicious sellers and buyers may be motivated

to transact illegal products. Our efforts to mitigate risk are made more complex by the number of new

products regularly added, our global user base, and sellers' attempts to circumvent our controls.

Consequently, it is evident that a certain level of residual risks persists on the Platform. Based on the

inherent risk score and mitigation effectiveness score of this risk module, the residual risk score is

qualified as “Medium” which is comparable to Year 1. Nonetheless, we strive to continue working

towards minimising the risk of disseminating P\&C products through the Platform.



Inherent Risk Mitigation Effectiveness Score Residual Risks



Based on the probability and

severity scores calculated using

the DSA Risk Assessment Rating

Methodology, the inherent risk

score is assessed as “High”,

which indicates that the

probability of the occurrence of

risks is high, and they have the

potential to have a significant

negative impact on users.



Overall, the mitigation

implementations are effective

and resulted in a decreased

exposure of non-compliant

products on the Platform.



The mitigation effectiveness

score is calculated to be

“Strong” (78%), which indicates

minimal likelihood of a control

failure.



Based on the inherent risk

score and mitigation

effectiveness score, the

residual risk remains

“Medium” on the Platform,

which indicates a moderate

level of concern around the

likelihood or impact of risks

arising to users on the Platform

after mitigation measures have

been applied.



V. Conclusion and Future Mitigations



In Year 2, the residual risks rating of “Medium” has remained unchanged from Year 1. This is primarily

due to the inherent risks remaining similar to Year 1 and the continued progress on new and existing

mitigation measures in Year 2.

Non-Confidential version



27



We will continue to build up from the residual risk mitigation roadmap committed to in Year 1, to

address the residual risks. To target potential insufficiencies identified in the Year 2 Risk Assessment,

we plan on improving our mitigation measures against P\&C products in the following areas:



● Enhancing effectiveness and accuracy of content moderation: We will keep building up our

moderation task force, hiring more human moderators to meet up with the volume of content

moderation on non-compliant products on the Platform. We will also equip human

moderators with better tools, developing automatic pop-up reminders for them to help refer

to available information concerning the identified risk type, which will enhance the content

moderation’s effectiveness and accuracy.



● Monitoring automatic penalties imposed on risky products: We will implement a monitoring

mechanism on the automatic penalties imposed on risky products detected by the Platform’s

risk control system. This monitoring mechanism will send early warnings on detected

abnormal penalties or absence of penalty, which will ensure the timeliness and consistency of

automatic penalties enacted by the system.



● Enlarging the scope of applying image-identification algorithms in risk detection: We will

increase the usage of image-identification algorithms, particularly those specialised in

detecting similarity between pictures, in our risk detection system, which will further enhance

the risk detection effectiveness.



● Building up the Platform’s archive of product manufacturers and EU-responsible persons:

We will keep working on the implementation of the dedicated compliance project regarding

the General Product Safety Regulation (EU/2023/988) (GPSR). We will enlarge the scope of

information collection on product manufacturers and EU-responsible persons, and will

communicate such information to consumers and regulators as required under the GPSR.



● Upgrading recall notifications on dangerous products: Based on the original recall notice

process of informing concerned sellers and buyers, we will set up a new product recall

notification channel to inform the authority’s “Safety Business Gate” and also the product

manufacturers regarding the Product safety issue.

Non-Confidential version

VIII. Intellectual Property Rights



I. Risk Definition



In the IPR module, we have analysed the risk(s) that the Platform may be utilised to disseminate, or

contribute to the dissemination of, “IPR-infringing content”. AliExpress defines this as content that

violates any rights related to Intellectual Property (“IP”) rights, including copyright, trademarks,

patents, design rights and geographical indications. Our IPR protection policies have been defined in

accordance with applicable EU laws, including Directive 2001/29/EC (“the Copyright Directive”),

Directive 2004/48/EC (“the Enforcement Directive”) and Directive (EU) 2019/790 (“the Directive on

Copyright in the Digital Single Market”). As outlined in the Year 1 Report, IPR covers:



● Copyright infringements, which are understood as any unauthorised use of copyrighted

material such as text, images, videos, music, or software on the product or its packaging, as

well as the unauthorised usage of copyrighted works on product listing(s).

● Trademark infringements, which includes the unauthorised use of a trademark on / or in

connection with goods in a manner that is likely to cause confusion, deception, or mistake

about the source of the goods. This covers the sale of counterfeit products.

● Design infringements, which includes the unauthorised use of a product appearance, shape

or ornamentation protected by a design.

● Patent infringements, which covers innovations, including the unauthorised use of a product,

service or process involving inventive step and industrial application protected by a patent.

In addition, considering the relevance of Alibaba's recent contribution to the 2024 Counterfeit and

Piracy Watch List Public Consultation carried out by DG TRADE - Investment and Intellectual

Property10, [replaced by footnote 10], that expands on Alibaba IPR protection efforts and initiatives

over the last two years, including regarding AliExpress.



II. Inherent Risk



Given the dynamic nature of the risk and the high volume of sellers attempting to list IPR infringing

products, AliExpress has conducted a more in-depth analysis in Year 2, building upon the baseline of

risk identified in Year 1. This analysis focuses on how various Platform features and factors, including

those outlined in Article 34(2)(a) of the DSA, contribute to this risk.



a. Risks from Platform Design and Functionalities, including their misuse



As introduced in the Year 1 Report, the main source of IPR risks on online marketplaces is that users,

specifically sellers, will attempt to disseminate IPR-infringing content by uploading or modifying



10 https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/e9d50ad8-e41f-4379-839a-fdfe08f0aa96/library/bb3232d2-64cb-41f9-9e96-

e0822a119956/details

Non-Confidential version



29



product listings. [Confidential]. IPR-infringing content can be concealed among this information (e.g.,

using dashes between the letters of a trademarked brand).



There is a risk that sellers may post a seemingly innocuous listing to hide the sale of IPR-violating

products. Other Platform functionalities may contribute to this risk. For example, buyers and sellers

may misuse the IM functionality to provide details of the actual IPR-infringing product that is being

sold. Further, users could share hyperlinks to violating goods, either on AliExpress’ IM or on external

platforms (so-called "hidden links"). In fact, due to AliExpress’ success in combating counterfeits on

the Platform, bad actors appear to have increasingly resorted to hidden link schemes that originate

off-platform to leverage external platforms or other sites over which our safeguards do not apply.11

Similarly, IPR-infringing products (as well as P\&C Products) could be promoted through the Affiliate

Program.



Another risk is that sellers may misuse the livestreaming function to draw attention to IPR-infringing

goods. Beyond sellers, it’s important to recognise that IPR risks can also be driven by buyers actively

seeking to purchase infringing products. [Confidential]. Such strategies are often shared on external

platforms, for example discussion forums on social media services.



In Year 2, our continuous monitoring of the EU risk environment identified two main events with

potential impacts on IPR risks: the UEFA European Football Championship and the 2024 Paris

Olympics12. These events were identified as posing a heightened risk of bad actors attempting to

exploit the popularity of these sporting competitions to sell IPR-infringing products on the Platform,

thereby violating the IPR of the rights holders.



b. Risks from Other Factors of the Platform (in line with Article 34(2) of the DSA)



Both in Year 1 and Year 2, we assessed how the factors listed in Article 34(2) of the DSA may influence

IPR risks. Please refer to Section VI for more context on these factors.

● Advertising systems and data practices: There is an inherent risk that sellers will select IPR-

infringing products to advertise. While it is not possible to assess the full scale of this risk, the

historical volume of detected infringements can serve as a proxy for this particular risk. Among

the 2,764,070 product listings removed by the Platform due to IPR violations in the time period

from 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024, 399,303 ([Confidential]) infringing product listings were

advertised.

● Content moderation systems: AliExpress’ content moderation systems are designed to

reduce IPR risks. However, algorithmic detection systems may at times be unable to identify



11 Please refer to Annex 6, i.e., Alibaba's recent contribution to the 2024 Counterfeit and Piracy Watch List Public

Consultation carried out by DG TRADE - Investment and Intellectual Property, for more information regarding

hidden links.



12 The Global IP Enforcement Team had extensive engagement with Olympic representatives leading up to, and

during, the Olympics to help ensure the maximum effect of proactive efforts and to expedite the removal of

infringing product listings.

Non-Confidential version



30



IPR-infringing content (e.g., in the case of insufficient training data). From 1 July 2023 to 30

June 2024, 687,127 product listings were removed for IPR violations through reactive means,

in other words, they were not removed by the Platform’s proactive moderation systems.

● Recommender system: There is a risk that some IPR-violating products, once published, may

be recommended to users through our recommender system if sellers manage to evade our

proactive content moderation tools. In the time period from 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024,

1,272,175 products have been recommended and removed due to IPR infringements.

● Relevant policies: As legislation gets updated in various countries, our IPR policy may become

outdated and thus needs to be continuously iterated upon.

Given that we operate as a marketplace, the potential theoretical risk—assuming no controls are in

place—of widespread dissemination of IPR-infringing products is “Medium High”. While it is not

possible to measure the risk without any controls in place, this risk can be estimated by examining the

number of IPR holders whose rights may have been violated - from 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024, 6,741

right-holders submitted 946,009 IPR notices to AliExpress. This risk can also be proxied by identifying

the proportion of products involved in IPR infringements relative to the total number of listings on the

Platform. From 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024, 2,764,070 product listings were removed for IPR

infringements [Confidential].



III. Existing Mitigations



In Year 2, we continued to operate strong control mechanisms and further enhanced our IPR controls

through our Year 1 mitigation commitments. We also adapted them to address specific events that

could act as IPR risk vectors in the EU.



a. Algorithmic Controls



The core of our IPR controls has not changed from Year 1. In terms of technological tools, we have

algorithmic control systems in place to detect IPR-infringing products and AliExpress takes a proactive

approach to detecting IPR violations. When a seller creates or modifies a listing, the listing contents

are screened for suspicious content by our text-based, image-based, and combined indicators

algorithmic systems. Flagged listings are reviewed by the IPR product review team and new

infringements are included to the internal database of IPR-infringing elements that the algorithmic

systems use to iteratively improve. Algorithmic quality assurance helps ensure that the algorithmic

tools stay comprehensive and up to date with emerging risks and possible infringements. Algorithmic

controls also check the similarities between new applicants and previous violators to prevent

‘blacklisted’ users from re-registering. In the period between 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024, 75.1% of

the total number of product listings removed for IPR violation were proactively removed by our

algorithmic controls. Currently, we have over 2,000 brands in our brands database, which enables the

training of our algorithmic systems to swiftly identify new product listings with potential IPR risks.

b. Internal Risk Identification



Our specialist teams are fundamental to ensure our policies are effectively enforced. Manual reviews

are primarily managed by the CRO team, who may allocate specific tasks to specialised teams. For

example, there are specialised teams that review algorithmic flags following a SOP that is regularly

updated. AliExpress teams conduct weekly checks using product samples to proactively monitor and

assess the prevalence of non-compliant products on the Platform. In addition, third-party teams

perform independent sampling and analysis of products on the Platform and report their findings. As

mentioned in Section VII (the P\&C module), in addition to product-level checks, there are also account-

level verifications. Sellers are required to undergo verification to review their qualifications as a trader

and funding account information.



c. External Risk Identification



Beyond proactive detection, users (registered or unregistered; rights holders or not) have multiple

avenues to report IPR infringements, including an email address (ipr@alibaba-inc.com), a notice form,

and a dedicated IP protection portal for rights holders. Similar to our mitigation efforts for P\&C

Product risks, we further collaborate with external professional organisations (see Section VII on P\&C

module) to improve our enforcement of IPR policies.



d. Policies and Enforcement



Our relevant policies prohibit any posting or offering for sale of products that infringe on IP rights and

set out appropriate penalties, should any infringement be identified. These policies are kept up to

date with evolving risk vectors, as our teams actively monitor public opinion, regulatory changes, and

other relevant factors. (For further information, please refer to Section VII - P\&C Products.)



Additionally, our brand authorisation system has been developed to enhance our ability to inspect the

documentation related to brand authorisation when a seller seeks approval to sell products from

certain brands.



Case Study: Enhanced Guidelines for the Euro 2024 and the Paris Olympics



Recognising the potential for increased IPR violations during major international events, we have

proactively engaged with rights holders, worked closely on exchange of know-how and information

which enabled us to establish clear guidelines and controls to prevent the unauthorised usage or

selling of protected content.



We published two specific user guidelines (in Chinese) to address IPR issues related to these high-

risk events this year, the Euro 2024 and the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. These guidelines, released

in May 2024, indicated the wordmarks, image trademarks, host city logos, football jerseys, etc. that

would constitute an infringement of IP rights linked to these events.



The specific policies can be accessed through the following links:

Non-Confidential version



32



● UEFA 2024 Guidelines

● Paris 2024 Olympic Games Guidelines



During the event enhanced-controls period, the following data was recorded:

● Number of listings reactively and proactively removed due to the Euro 2024 guidelines:

3,166

● Number of listings reactively and proactively removed due to the Olympics guidelines: 2,861



Among the removed listings, the number of listings removed reactively is 0 in both sports events,

which suggests that our proactive detection mechanisms are functioning with strong efficacy.



User education and awareness can bolster safety on online platforms. AliExpress provides IPR training

to users through programs like AliExpress Zhibei 13 , which trains participating sellers to avoid

unintended IPR violations. This training is provided through a continuous online program, with the

publication dates for each section available on the AliExpress Zhibei website.



e. Advertising System and Recommender System Specific Controls



Regarding advertising systems, listings undergoing review by teams for potential violations are

excluded from the advertising pool. For our recommender system, we implemented keyword blocking

in the search function for a number of well-known and reputable brands at risk of having their

products or brands infringed upon at their request. We also conducted internal assessments to

prevent similar listings from appearing on the results page.



f. Content Moderation System Specific Controls



IPR risks related to content moderation systems are mitigated by regularly improving our IPR

knowledge bases, which ensures that algorithmic systems are kept up to date. We also continuously

refine the thresholds used in our detection algorithms. Furthermore, we monitor and aim to improve

the proactive catch rate as a proxy for measuring algorithmic control effectiveness. IPR-related teams

participate in rigorous training programs on IPR protection, including receiving training from right

holders or from external legal consultants, typically arranged twice a year. There are internal trainings

based on the updated IPR SOPs from time to time. Additionally, the appeals process gives users an

avenue to contest moderation decisions if their content was inaccurately actioned for violating IPR.



g. New Mitigation Measures



In line with Year 1 commitments, we have, in the past twelve months, made significant improvements

to the effectiveness of our mitigation measures. Notably:

33



● Improved our Internal IPR-knowledge base. We have enhanced our IPR knowledge base by

providing rights holders with three dedicated portals to submit takedown notices. We are

committed to further strengthening our collaboration with stakeholders to gather more data

and improve our IPR enforcement capabilities. For instance, we added over 400 brands to our

IPR-violations monitoring list between Year 1 and Year 2. Additionally, we receive regular

feedback from rights holders through our participation in the EU Memorandum of

Understanding on the Sale of Counterfeit Goods, effective from 2016. These enhancements

to our IPR knowledge base ensure that our algorithmic control systems remain robust and

effective.

● Improved our IPR-violation detection algorithms. We have continuously improved our IPR

violation detection algorithms by incorporating the multimodal classification algorithm, which

uses both text and images to identify risks more accurately by analysing and interpreting

information from both textual and visual modalities. In September 2023, new algorithms for

similar and identical product search were added, increasing the effectiveness of IPR protection.

Additionally, we have integrated sellers’ histories of suspicious behaviours and past IPR

infringements into our algorithms, to enable more robust identification and prevention

strategies against counterfeit products and abnormal pricing.

● Stronger restrictions against abuse: Since December 2023, the IPR restriction rules

differentiate between intentional and unintentional violations and we take stricter action

against repeat infringements.

● Choice service controls: Choice products undergo stricter controls than products sold by other

sellers. Dedicated AliExpress teams curate and screen Choice sellers, to reduce the risk that

IPR-infringing products will be published. In addition, under Choice’s ‘full-entrustment’ model,

most products will be placed within AliExpress-designated warehouses and manually

inspected, with any violating products being withdrawn (read Section VII on P\&C module for

more details).

● Voluntary recalls of infringing products: Since August 2023, we proactively recall products

identified as IPR infringing to mitigate IPR risks. The Platform is also working to improve the

timeliness of dispute resolutions for illegal products (including counterfeits) to under 2

business days.

● Collaboration with professional service providers: In 2024, in addition to considering buyer

feedback and our analysis of referrer websites, we engaged in a partnership with a European

service provider that specialises in IPR protection and detection of hidden links. This

collaboration helps us identify and manage IPR risks by sharing intelligence to take

enforcement actions, such as taking action against the related sellers on AliExpress as well as

to report for removal, infringing content from third-party websites.



● Strengthened controls against misuse:

○ Since April 2024, to further mitigate the risk of IPR infringements arising from the

Affiliate Program, once an infringement is discovered, AliExpress disconnects the

product link shared by the affiliate, blocks any commissions for related orders, and

suspends the accounts of repeat offenders.

Non-Confidential version



34



○ The CRO - Transaction Security team analyses the sources of traffic to the Platform

once a month and checks if any are related to third-party websites that promote

counterfeit products.

● Updated policies: As explained above, we produced guidelines for the UEFA Football

Championship and the Paris 2024 Olympics to adapt to emerging risks related to IPR. These

policies were enforced and during the duration of these events; 3,166 listings were removed

under the UEFA Guidelines and 2,861 listings under the Olympic Guidelines, respectively.



IV. Residual Risk



Despite our best efforts to mitigate the risk of IPR-infringing products on the Platform through

proactive and reactive measures, we cannot fully eliminate the risk due to the dynamic nature of the

risk landscape, where new illegal products may arise and malicious sellers and buyers may be

motivated to transact IPR-infringing products. Furthermore, hidden link schemes originate outside of

our Platform where our safeguards cannot be applied. Our efforts to mitigate risk are made more

complex by the volume of newly added listings, our global user base and the continuously and rapidly

evolving strategies to distribute IPR infringing and counterfeit goods. Consequently, a certain level of

residual risk persists on the Platform.



Based on the inherent risk score and mitigation effectiveness score of this risk module, the residual

risk score is qualified as “Low Medium”. Nonetheless, we continue to work towards minimising the

risk of disseminating IPR-infringing products through the Platform.



Inherent Risk Mitigation Effectiveness Score Residual Risks



Based on the probability and

severity scores calculated using

the DSA Risk Assessment Rating

Methodology, the inherent risk

score is assessed as “Medium

High”, which indicates that

there is a relatively high

probability of the risks

occurring during the provision

of the service, and they have

obvious negative impacts on

users.



Overall, the mitigation

implementations are effective

and resulted in a decreased

exposure of non-compliant

content on the Platform.



The mitigation effectiveness

score is calculated to be

“Strong” (71%), which indicates

minimal likelihood of a control

failure.



Based on the inherent risk

score and mitigation

effectiveness score, the

residual risk remains “Low

Medium” on the Platform,

which indicates a moderately

low level of concern around the

likelihood or impact of risks

arising to users on the Platform

after mitigation measures have

been applied.



V. Conclusion and Future Mitigations



In Year 2, the residual risk rating of “Low Medium” has remained unchanged from Year 1. This is

primarily due to the inherent risks remaining similar to Year 1 and the continued progress on new and

existing mitigation measures in Year 2.

Non-Confidential version



35



To address the residual risks, we will continue to build up from the residual risk mitigation roadmap

committed to in Year 1. Targeting potential insufficiencies identified in the Year 2 Risk Assessment, we

plan on improving our mitigation measures against IPR risks in the following areas:

● Increased penalties for policy violations: For more severe IPR infringement violations, we will

increase the financial penalties deducted from the seller’s performance security deposit to

improve the effectiveness of our policy enforcement.

● Strengthened cooperation with brand rights holders: We will launch the Brandsafe project

to provide tools and data insights about counterfeit goods control for brand rights holders in

order to collaboratively tackle the spread of counterfeit goods.

Non-Confidential version

IX. Content Compliance



I. Risk Definition



In the Content Compliance (“CC”) module, AliExpress analysed the risk(s) that the Platform may be

used to disseminate, or contribute to the dissemination of, harmful and illegal user-generated content

(“UGC”) beyond the scope of the P\&C and the IPR modules. The CC module analyses the risks that

UGC in whatever shape or surface – i.e. text or images in product reviews, IM messages, etc. – may

contribute to the dissemination of illegal content as well as negatively impacting fundamental rights

that may manifest through the sharing of UGC, including non-discrimination, and protection against

gender-based violence. Content Compliance module includes an analysis of the dissemination of UGC

that follows EU and other European laws and regulations, including the 2008/913/JHA Framework

Decision (“Framework Decision on combating certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia

by means of criminal law”), Regulation (EU) 2021/784 (“Regulation on Terrorist Content Online”)

Directive (EU) 2011/93 (“Directive on Combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children

and child pornography”), Directive (EU) 2024/1385 (“Directive on combating violence against women

and domestic violence”) and the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence

against women and domestic violence. UGC that violates AliExpress’ Terms and Conditions as well as

policies is hereafter referred to as “non-compliant content”.



As outlined in the Year 1 Report and the Community Guidelines, non-compliant content covers:



● Illegal hate speech and unlawful discriminatory content: Any kind of communication in

speech, writing or behaviour, that attacks or uses pejorative or discriminatory language with

reference to a user (buyer or seller) or a group on the basis of who they are e.g., based on

religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, colour, descent, gender or other identity.

● Harms to human dignity: Any kind of content that is libellous, defamatory, harassing,

threatening, insulting, obscene, pornographic, obscene, offensive, untrue, false, exaggerated

or misleading.

● Terrorist content: Any kind of content that promotes, celebrates, or justifies terrorist activities,

ideologies, or propaganda. This includes content that advocates violence, glorifies terrorist

acts or individuals, or spreads hate speech and slogans associated with terrorism.

● Public security: Any kind of content that endangers national sovereignty and security,

advocates for wars or military conflicts, disseminates violence, or promotes the misuse of illicit

drugs or chemicals.

● Child sexual abuse material (“CSAM”): Any kind of sexually explicit images or descriptions or

pornographic and vulgar content around children.

● Harm to cultural, religious and linguistic diversity: Any kind of content that incites ethnic

hatred and discrimination.

● Gender-based violence and Non-consensual sharing of private images: Any kind of content

that advocates for violence against women, doxxed individuals, or fabricates false information

to damage the reputation of others.

Non-Confidential version



37



II. Inherent Risk



Between Year 1 and Year 2, the Content Compliance risk landscape has remained stable. In Year 2, we

conducted a more in-depth analysis of how different Platform features and factors (including those

listed in Article 34(2)(a) of the DSA may contribute to the risk.



a. Risks from Platform Design and Functionalities, including their misuse



Content issues on AliExpress primarily stem from information related to non-compliant products that

are identified during the product control process, which will be deleted. Beyond that, UGC creates

additional content-related risks on the Platform. We offer a variety of interactive features designed to

enhance the user experience but these also may pose risks. Features such as customer reviews, Q\&A

sections, and IM can be misused to disseminate non-compliant content, including hate speech, explicit

images, and illegal product information. Customisation options for user profiles and stores, along with

marketing tools like push notifications and email marketing, also carry the risk of promoting non-

compliant content. Additionally, the Affiliate Program and livestreaming features present specific

issues in controlling the spread of non-compliant content, particularly given the potential for off-

platform transactions and the real-time nature of live broadcasts.



There is a risk that users may misuse the Platform functionalities to publish non-compliant content

and avoid detection. This may occur through attempts to evade keyword and image detection by

manipulating images and text. Additionally, abuse of the Platform’s IM or chat features could involve

the use of bots to generate spam or harass users.



b. Risks from Other Factors of the Platform (in line with Article 34(2) of the DSA)



Both in Year 1 and Year 2, we assessed how the factors listed in Article 34(2) of the DSA may influence

the risks of disseminating harmful content. Please refer to Section VI for more context on these factors.



● Advertising systems and data practices: There is an inherent risk that sellers could use

AliExpress’ advertising systems to publish non-compliant advertising content (e.g., in the

product photo, product description, etc). From 27 May 2024 to 26 August 2024, we blocked

or deleted 1,062,965 advertisements due to non-compliant content, [Confidential].14



● Recommender system: There is a risk that AliExpress’ recommender system, by means of

search keywords and ad words, could potentially expose or disseminate prohibited content,

as it may inadvertently amplify and recommend non-compliant or harmful content if certain

keywords gain traction among users. From 6 August to 25 August 2024 we have blocked or

deleted 8,337,262 non-compliant content recommended by AliExpress’ recommender

systems [Confidential].15



14 Our system log stores data for only the past three months in this respect.



15 The relatively shorter data period is due to the storage time limit of our system logs in the EU.

Non-Confidential version



38



● Relevant policies: As legislation gets updated in various countries, our Content Compliance

policy could become outdated and thus would need to be continuously iterated upon. At the

policy enforcement level, the effectiveness of implementing Platform policies is influenced by

various factors such as risk control tools, technical capabilities, and human resources, which

may experience errors and failures. Between 1 July 2023 and 30 June 2024, we have updated

our AliExpress Community Guidelines once for these purposes.

● Content moderation systems: Our content moderation systems are designed to reduce risks

around non-compliant content. However, algorithmic detection systems could fail to identify

infringing content (e.g., in the case of insufficient training, particularly on diverse languages).

The number and expertise of manual reviewers could also be insufficient to promptly and

accurately handle flagged content. Additionally, there may be challenges in moderating real-

time situations like IM or livestreaming. In this regard, the number of non-compliant content

detected through reactive reports from 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024 is 11,682.



Given that AliExpress operates as a marketplace, the spread of violating content (different from

product listings) is a comparatively less prevalent risk. Assuming no controls were in place, the

potential theoretical risk of widespread dissemination of non-compliant content is “Very Unlikely”.

While it is not possible to measure the risk without any controls in place, this risk can be estimated by

considering the total amount of content proactively blocked and reactively removed worldwide. For

example, from 27 May 2024 to 26 August 2024, the total number of non-compliant user-generated

content blocked or removed amounted to 6,234,972 [Confidential].



III. Existing Mitigations



In Year 2, we continued to operate strong control mechanisms and further enhanced our content

controls through our Year 1 mitigation commitments. The mitigation measures can be grouped into

several key areas: the overall process for content compliance risk identification and mitigation, the

tools developed for specific mitigation purposes, and the taskforce and their management.



a. Detection Mechanisms: Automated Blocking and Manual Review



We have two risk control mechanisms, pre-live and post-live, to ensure that prohibited content is

identified and blocked automatically and in a timely manner.



Pre-live system

The pre-live system acts as the first line of defence, where content is automatically reviewed against

a combination of restricted keywords, algorithms, and risk behaviour indicators to effectively identify

non-compliant content before it is published. These algorithms are designed to identify and block

content that violates Platform policies. For instance, by extracting text from images and cross-

referencing it with a database of restricted keywords, or by assessing visual content for elements

associated with known violative content. Risk management personnel will also conduct manual checks

on the generated results.

Non-Confidential version



39



Post-live system

For most professional and user-generated content, our risk management system operates as a pre-

live mechanism, requiring all content to pass through the system before being published online.

[Confidential]. In these channels, where an instant response is required, content is published online

first and then taken down if it is identified as non-compliant content. This approach balances the user

preference for swift content publication with the need to mitigate non-compliant content

dissemination.



b. Policies and Enforcement



Policy enforcement is a critical aspect of our content compliance strategy. The Platform has developed

a comprehensive set of policies, outlined in our Community Guidelines and specific policies for

different channels like AliExpress Live. In professional and user generated content channels, users

must follow these policies. These policies are designed to cover a wide range of content-related risks,

from hate speech and terrorist content to public security threats and non-consensual activities, and

are monitored to ensure coverage of potential crisis scenarios, new risk trends and to align them with

relevant EU and member states' legal requirements. Enforcement measures include immediate

content blocking, temporary restriction on posting of content, manual reviews of high-traffic content,

and more severe penalties for users who repeatedly violate the rules. For severe violations, AliExpress

may disable user accounts temporarily or permanently, depending on the nature and frequency of the

infractions. For livestreams, the Platform also stipulates onboarding requirements in order that only

reputable sellers and influencers are allowed to use this channel.



c. Enhancements to Proactive Controls



We monitor the algorithms’ predicted violation scores and other performance indicators of the

detection algorithm, which are used to enhance our proactive mitigation strategies.



The monitoring of the performance of the proactive controls allows us to enhance the effectiveness

of the automated risk detection and blocking mechanisms by continually optimising the risk

management systems, strategies and algorithms. For instance, risk management personnel provide

restricted keywords and detected prohibited content as a training dataset to the algorithm team to

improve text algorithm performance. To enhance detection performance, risk behaviour indicators

are used alongside algorithms, such as by correlating specific non-compliant keywords with searches

for related product categories to expand recall rate.



d. Strong Reactive Controls



The manual review team is tasked with manually reviewing content that has been flagged by the

system but not conclusively identified by automated systems as non-compliant. By combining

automated detection and manual verification, we aim to effectively mitigate the risk of non-compliant

content being disseminated across all professional and user generated content channels on AliExpress.

Additionally, we have reporting channels available on the Platform, and relevant teams (including the

customer service team, the internal inspection team, and the public sentiment team) are involved in

Non-Confidential version



40



the monitoring and discovery of residual non-compliant content. The risk management team collects

and verifies reports and cases, then takes down the non-compliant content accordingly. From 1 July

2023 to 30 June 2024, the number of non-compliant content items detected through reactive reports

amounted to 11,682. During the same period, there were 55 successful appeals worldwide for

compliant content that were wrongly enforced.



e. Measures Against Risk of Reappearance of Non-Compliant Content



We also take proactive steps to prevent the reappearance of non-compliant content. The Platform

channels new violation data into a structured online library, which helps in identifying emerging risks

and keeping an updated database of prohibited keywords. Stricter penalties are imposed on repeat

offenders, and mechanisms are in place to prevent banned sellers from re-registering on the Platform.



f. New Mitigation Measures



In line with Year 1 commitments, we have, in the past twelve months, made significant improvements

to the effectiveness of our mitigation measures. Notably:



● Enhanced our risks controls and SOPs: We have conducted a thorough assessment of our

content risk controls, updated the content risk register and scope, and enhanced the internal

SOPs for managing content risks. Between 1 July 2023 and 30 June 2024, we have updated

these content risk control SOPs 26 times, covering risk areas such as public security, CSAM

and pornographic content, etc. The updates involved clarifying grey area cases to ensure more

accurate policy enforcement while safeguarding user experience.

● Increased our complaint and appeal mechanisms for non-registered users: We have also

provided easily accessible appeal and complaint portals for users to make reports and

challenge moderation decisions. In particular, this year we launched a notice submission tool

aimed at non-registered users (but also open to registered users), available on the Platform

(accessible from the site footer) to facilitate the submission of notices about any non-

compliant content on the Platform by non-registered users. When the reporting party submits

a report through the general online notice submission form, the system immediately sends an

automated email to confirm receipt of the report. The report is reviewed by the relevant

competent team. Once a decision is made, we communicate this to the reporting party by

email. The reporting party can also query the status of the notice using the report ID, through

the following link on our website (for non-registered users). In case of successful appeals, we

have updated processes to quickly restore content.

● Updated our algorithmic detection capabilities: We launched a new text algorithm model for

detecting illegal content, optimised for pornographic and vulgar content, information on

illegal provision of services. [Confidential] In July 2024, through a combination of algorithmic

detection and subsequent manual review, we found and deleted 62,206 illegal pieces of

content through this algorithm. We are also developing a multilingual text algorithm

incorporating EU languages based on a Natural language processing model (NLP). This NLP has

Non-Confidential version



41



expanded the language list of our risk management system and will allow for more localised

control of risks in more countries (e.g., detecting risks from slang).

● Additional human content moderators: To enhance our human moderation capabilities, we

have added 6 human moderators focusing on non-English content (specifically, Spanish,

Portuguese, French and German). Also, the content moderation team for recommended

keywords has increased [Confidential].

● Introduced moderation for AI Generated content: The rapid growth of AI-generated content

(AIGC) in text and image formats may pose significant challenges to our risk management

system. To address this, we have deployed algorithms designed to detect and mitigate content

compliance risks by monitoring inputs (user-provided context) and outputs (AI-generated text

and images). If compliance risks are detected, AI-generated results are blocked to ensure

content safety.



IV. Residual Risk



Despite our best efforts to mitigate the risk of the dissemination of harmful and illegal user-generated

content on the Platform through proactive and reactive measures, we cannot fully eliminate the risk

due to the dynamic nature of the risk landscape, with motivated malicious actors spreading such

content and the continuously evolving nature of the strategies used to evade our controls. Our efforts

to mitigate this risk are further complicated by the multiple avenues of content dissemination, the

diverse global user base, and the avenues for instant sharing of content on the Platform. Consequently,

it is evident that a certain level of residual risks persists on the Platform. Based on the inherent risk

score and mitigation effectiveness score of this risk module, the residual risk score is qualified as “Low”.

Nonetheless, we continue to work towards minimising the risk of disseminating such content through

the Platform.



Inherent Risk Mitigation Effectiveness Score Residual Risks



Based on the probability and

severity scores calculated using

the DSA Risk Assessment Rating

Methodology, the inherent risk

score is assessed as “Low

Medium”, which indicates that

the probability of the

occurrence of risks is low, and

they have the potential to have

a low impact on users.



Overall, the mitigation

implementations are effective

and resulted in a decreased

exposure of non- compliant

content on the Platform.



The mitigation effectiveness

score is calculated to be

“Moderate” (60%), indicating

minor likelihood of a control

failure.



Based on the inherent risk

score and mitigation

effectiveness score, the

residual risk remains “Low” on

the Platform, which indicates a

low level of concern around the

likelihood or impact of risks

arising to users on the Platform

after mitigation measures have

been applied.

Non-Confidential version



42



V. Conclusion and Future Mitigations



In Year 2, the residual risks rating of “Low” has remained unchanged from Year 1. This is primarily due

to the inherent risks remaining similar to Year 1 and the continued progress on new and existing

mitigation measures in Year 2.



We will continue to build up from the residual risk mitigation roadmap committed to in Year 1, to

address the residual risks. We plan on improving our mitigation measures against Content Compliance

risks in the following areas, to target potential insufficiencies identified in the Year 2 Risk Assessment:

● Strengthening our detection capabilities: We plan to continue strengthening our detection

capabilities for emerging risks by expanding reporting channels for more risk scenarios. We

will also continue to optimise our content risk algorithms to improve our risk control

capabilities. Specifically, we will develop a large redline text model to improve prevention and

control capabilities under scenarios of multi-languages and small amounts of samples and to

improve risk recall levels. To improve the overall accuracy of algorithmic controls, we will

adopt the approach of leveraging both keyword identification using traditional models and

large language models. We will also analyse similar semantic and search behaviours to

proactively discover new non-compliant content with similar risks to known non-compliant

content.

● Enhance controls around fake ratings, fake reviews and spam messages: We will strengthen

controls against non-compliant content arising from fake ratings, fake reviews and spam

messages specifically. On fake ratings and reviews, we will continuously collect data and

analyse the behaviour patterns of click farming, and optimise the algorithm recognition logic

and accuracy of fake user reviews identification. Meanwhile, we will revise the penalty rules

and strengthen the removal of merchants who have been identified as engaging in click

farming. On spam messages, we will focus on enhancing our capabilities to identify and block

spam advertisements by improving our text and image similarity algorithms, and algorithmic

detection of abnormal mailboxes and gangs.

● Enhance our tiered penalty system: We plan to implement a more targeted governance

approach for repeated violations across a broader range of content scenarios. By adopting a

layered penalty system, we aim to effectively reduce the risk of repeated violations. This may

involve measures such as blocking/deleting content, disabling the ability to publish content,

suspending accounts, and permanently closing accounts for repeat offenders.

Non-Confidential version



43



X. Data Protection



I. Risk Definition



In the Data Protection module, we have analysed the risk(s) relating to the processing, storage and

usage of personal data on the Platform. Our definition of 'personal data' is drawn from the GDPR (as

defined below) and refers to any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person

(‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in

particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an

online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental,

economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. Our data protection policies were defined

in accordance with applicable EU laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),

EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, European Convention on Human Rights, and the European Court

of Human Rights Decisions. As defined in the Year 1 Report, Data Protection covers:



● Protection of personal data, which is understood as the protections around the collection,

use, disclosure, storage, and deletion of personal information by the Platform.

● Right for Respect for private and family life, which, in accordance with the ECHR cases, is

understood as respecting a person’s name, gender, sexual orientation and sexual life, and also

information about a person’s health, ethnic identity and racial origin, right to their image, and

their biometric information, including DNA samples, profiles, or fingerprints.



II. Inherent Risk



Between Year 1 and Year 2, the Data Protection risk landscape has remained stable. In Year 2, we

deepened the analysis of how different Platform features and factors (including those listed in Article

34(2)(a) of the DSA) may contribute to the risk.



a. Risks from Platform Design and Functionalities, including their misuse



In the context of data protection, the various functionalities of the Platform present potential for risks

if not carefully managed. As a global marketplace, AliExpress facilitates transactions between buyers

and sellers, which necessitates the exchange of personal information. While this exchange is essential

for the Platform’s operations, it also introduces the risk of misuse or unauthorised access to user data.



We also operate in multiple regions with varying data protection requirements, meaning that the

transfer of personal data across borders is an important area of focus. Data transferred to third-party

countries (namely countries outside of the European Economic Area) without proper controls in place

may pose risks such as cyber-attacks and data breaches.



In addition, partnerships with third parties on the Platform who offer users products and services not

offered directly by AliExpress (including payment service providers such as Alipay) or other companies

in the Alibaba Group present another layer of complexity. While these collaborations are essential for

fulfilling a transaction or for offering a broad range of services, they may be subject to Privacy Policies

Non-Confidential version



44



different from AliExpress' own. The risk may arise for users responding to a service offered by these

third parties on AliExpress without realising the different treatment of their personal data by these

parties.



There is also a risk that users may misuse the Platform functionalities to create risks to other users'

data. The seller operations platform provides data to sellers in order to help them fulfil orders,

however it may potentially be misused by sellers who could leak said data. Additionally, external

crawlers, cyberattacks on user accounts, and malicious hyperlinking by users could expose personal

data to unauthorised access, leading to concerns for users if no controls were in place.



b. Risks from Other Factors of the Platform (in line with Article 34(2) of the DSA)



Both in Year 1 and Year 2, we assessed how the factors listed in Article 34(2) of the DSA may influence

Data Protection risks. Please refer to Section VI for more context on these factors.

● Advertising systems: The processing of user data for targeted advertisements on AliExpress,

including the analysis of users’ buying and browsing behaviour, may pose privacy risks if not

properly controlled in a transparent manner. Without adequate controls, the basis for this

data processing could be undermined.

● Recommender system: While designed to personalise user experiences by tapping into

shopping habits, recommender systems carry the risk of exposing users to undesired

recommendations, creating the perception of privacy intrusions. This being said, users can

turn off personalisation themselves, but can also ask the Platform to do it for them. Between

1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024, only 3 EU users exercised Data Subject Right Requests (“DSRs”)

asking Platform to turn off the personalised recommendation function.

● Policies: As legislation gets updated in various countries, our Data Protection policy may

become outdated and may need to be continuously iterated upon to ensure it is up to date.

● Data Protection and content moderation systems: While data protection systems on

AliExpress are essential for mitigating risks, they themselves can introduce vulnerabilities if

not properly implemented or managed, with potential risks arising around the storage,

anonymisation, management, encryption, and security of data if no controls were in place.



Assuming no controls were in place, the potential theoretical risk of widespread data protection

related infringements is “Medium-High”. While it is not possible to measure the risk without any

controls in place, this risk can be estimated by considering the proactive data protection safeguard as

proxied by the number of users who exercised their data rights. For example, during the period from

1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024, [Confidential] users closed their accounts, representing 0.56% of

registered EU accounts.



III. Existing Mitigations



In Year 2, we continued operating strong control mechanisms and further enhanced our Data

protection controls through our Year 1 mitigation commitments. The mitigation measures can be

grouped into several key areas: the tools developed for proactive risk mitigation, the task force and

Non-Confidential version



45



its management, internal and external risk identification methods, and the relevant risk mitigation

workflows.



a. Technical Controls



We have implemented several mechanisms to enhance data protection and mitigate privacy risks. We

have introduced an anonymisation and encryption system [Confidential]. This system allows sellers to

use a specific [Confidential] for package sending instead of direct access to consumers’ delivery

information in plain form, thereby reducing the risk of privacy breaches. To further protect users’ data,

we allow sellers’ access to buyers’ personal information for only 90 days, and, for semi-fulfilled and

participating-warehouse-shipped orders, sellers are not able to view the buyer's personal information.



Additionally, we utilise data partitioning tools to further mitigate risks, and we classify data assets by

assigning security scores based on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, categorising them into

four security levels. This classification allows us to prioritise protective measures according to the

sensitivity and importance of the data. Our content moderation systems play a crucial role in

mitigating data protection risks by actively monitoring and filtering content. For instance, our traffic

risk identification system is designed to detect and manage bot traffic, including the malicious scraping

of sensitive personal information.



To protect against external data scraping and malicious cyber-attacks, we ensure that personal data is

anonymised when possible. For instances where non-encrypted transmission is required, we assess

the need for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection and anti-crawling measures. Additionally,

we leverage Alibaba’s traffic cleaning software, anti-intrusion firewalls, and an early warning system

to monitor and respond to potential threats in real time. Our anti-crawler systems and Web

Application Firewall are specifically deployed to block unauthorised bot access to interfaces containing

personal data. This aims to ensure that only legitimate requests are processed.



b. Policies and Enforcement



Our Privacy Policy is a key component in mitigating data protection risks on AliExpress. It clearly

outlines how we collect, process, store, and transmit personal data in compliance with GDPR principles

of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency. By detailing the types of information we collect and the

contexts in which it is processed, we empower users to understand and control their data. The policy

covers essential areas such as information collection, data retention, user rights, security measures,

and international data transfers, making sure users are informed and can exercise their rights,

including requesting data deletion or opting out of personalised ads.



AliExpress makes its Privacy Policy easily accessible through multiple channels, including the portal

and app settings, so users can fully understand how their data is handled. AliExpress users can exercise

their data subject rights via the Privacy Centre or by contacting the Data Protection Officer (DPO). For

instance, users can delete their accounts, unsubscribe from marketing messages, or turn off

personalised ads. Additionally, we display to EU users a cookie banner, allowing them to refuse data

Non-Confidential version



46



collection by cookies and other similar technologies. Between 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024, we received

496,852 EU user Data Subject Right Requests (DSRs) requesting the Platform to delete personal

accounts, unsubscribe from marketing messages, etc., which received a 100% response rate.



When users register with AliExpress, we will disclose what information is collected and its purpose, as

stated in our privacy policy. If the privacy policy is adjusted, users can access the latest and the

previous version of the Privacy Policy at any time. In some cases when we make major revisions to the

key terms of the Privacy Policy, users will be informed of these changes and will be prompted to read

and agree to the new terms.



c. Verification Processes



To prevent the misuse of anonymous or fake accounts, we implemented strong buyer and seller

verification processes. Buyers are required to create secure passwords and verify their identity via

phone or email. Sellers, especially those targeting EU consumers, undergo a robust onboarding

process where we collect and verify key information, including business details and their undertaking

to only offer products that comply with the applicable EU laws. Since March 2024, we have further

strengthened these controls by directly collecting additional information about the registration

authority for sellers during the onboarding process.



We also enforce strict security measures for third parties that may access user data. This includes

conducting data due diligence and making sure all collaborating third parties sign a Data Processing

Agreement where applicable. We adhere to the principle of sharing only the minimum necessary user

data with third parties to maintain security and privacy throughout our collaborations.



d. Internal Controls



We have designated a dedicated “Data Security Compliance Team” responsible for overseeing

personal information protection. This team formulates and maintains policies related to data security,

including the protection of personal information. Additionally, we have a “Compliance Risk

Management Team” to ensure the legality and compliance of all data security-related matters.



e. External Audits



We engage with external agencies, including the British Standards Institution (“BSI”), to conduct

annual audits of our information security and privacy management practices. These audits cover our

products, development, testing, and operational processes. During this past year we maintained our

ISO 27001 and ISO 27701 certifications, as confirmed by the BSI, reflecting our ongoing commitment

to maintaining high standards in data privacy and security.



f. Additional Controls



Data Transfers

Non-Confidential version



47



We take significant steps to mitigate data protection risks associated with the transfer of EU users’

personal data to non-EU countries. To ensure legal compliance, these data transfers are conducted

based on the necessity of fulfilling contracts between users and the Platform, the use of Standard

Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved by the European Commission, and/or explicit user consent. We

have also made efforts to minimise international data transfers by promoting the use of EU-based

warehouses, which not only enhances the user experience and speeds up logistics but also reduces

the number of logistics providers involved, thereby lowering the risk of data breaches. The personal

data of EU users is securely stored within the EU, specifically in a data centre located in Germany, with

cross-region crisis recovery back-ups in Singapore and the United States.



To protect the data of EU users under the Choice service, we have taken specific steps to limit sellers’

access to buyers’ personal information under the Choice service. For orders under the Choice service

where the cooperating warehouse handles logistics, sellers only see the warehouse address rather

than the buyer’s personal details, keeping that information more secure.



Privacy Risks from Third Parties

To mitigate privacy risks associated with third-party partners, we clearly inform users in our Privacy

Policy that we have relationships with other parties and websites to offer products and services that

we do not directly provide. We explicitly state that the AliExpress Privacy Policy does not apply to

these third-party or co-branded sites, and we advise users to review the relevant privacy policies of

these sites before engaging with any offers, products, or services they advertise.



g. New Mitigation Measures



In line with Year 1 commitments, we have, in the past twelve months, made significant improvements

to the effectiveness of our mitigation measures. Notably:



● Enhanced user control of personalised recommendation systems: We have enhanced our

personalised recommendation system, giving users greater control over their experience.

Users can now turn off personalised recommendations in our Privacy Centre and select

specific types of push notifications they wish to receive, such as order updates, promotions,

activities, and interaction alerts. Additionally, through the Cookie Preferences, users can

customise their data collection preferences, including choosing whether to accept specific

types of cookies to collect their own data, such as users can choose to reject advertising

cookies.

● Limiting seller's access to buyer's personal information in order page: In March 2024, we

updated the Seller’s Centre and completed the order-level anonymisation of buyer details in

the orders page viewable by sellers. For instance, sellers cannot view personal information in

orders that were completed over 90 days ago and in orders that the participating warehouse

is responsible for sending the products to the relevant buyers, helping to reduce unnecessary

data exposure. This update minimises unnecessary disclosure of buyer information, further

mitigating data protection risks.

● Development of personal data identification and protection system: We are actively

developing a personal data identification and protection system to continuously enhance data

Non-Confidential version



48



privacy through the identification, classification, control, and auditing of data assets, alongside

raising awareness and education on these topics. AliExpress has established a data security

platform that categorises and labels personal data, and we are currently optimising the

Platform to further improve personal data usage and protection.

● Third-party education and data protection policy: We provide education and training on

“personal information protection” for third parties, including logistics and customer service

providers, who may access or handle our users’ personal information. The training covered

key definitions, such as personal data, and provided guidance on data storage, transmission,

and processing. Additionally, we have established the “AliExpress Supplier Data Protection

Requirements” policy. We plan to continue offering regular training sessions, either bi-

annually or annually, to reinforce these practices and ensure ongoing compliance with data

protection standards.

● Optimisation of data subject right request handling: AliExpress has further optimised the

relevant SOP to better protect the rights of data subjects and enhance the response time and

processing effectiveness for related events. The updated SOP now includes detailed

processing steps, transfer processes, and designated responsibilities for each type of data

subject right request. For instance, when a user requests to disable personalised

recommendations, the receiving staff will create an internal processing work order, which is

then assigned to the appropriate team. Once the technical processing is completed, a

designated representative will promptly notify the user that their request has been fulfilled.



IV. Residual Risk



Despite our best efforts in mitigating the risks related to Data Protection on the Platform through

proactive and reactive measures, we cannot fully eliminate the risk due to the possibility of misuse or

unauthorised access to user data by sellers (who may require access to user data to fulfil orders). Our

efforts to mitigate this risk are further complicated by further risks due to potential vulnerabilities that

may arise throughout the data lifecycle. Consequently, it is evident that a certain level of residual risks

persists on the Platform. Based on the inherent risk score and mitigation effectiveness score of this

risk module, the residual risk score is qualified as “Low-Medium”. Nonetheless, we continue to work

towards minimising the risk of unauthorised access, transmission and use of data.

after mitigation measures have

been applied.



V. Conclusion and Future Mitigations



In Year 2, the residual risk rating of “Low-Medium” is reduced from the rating of “Medium” in Year 1.

Notably, we have updated the Year 2 methodology for calculating the risk probability to be more

accurate and relevant by considering the number of EU users exercising their data rights, instead of

considering the number of days where ESU events took place over a year. The reduced rating could

also be due to the continued progress on new and existing mitigation measures in Year 2.



We will continue to build up from the residual risk mitigation roadmap committed to in Year 1, to

address the residual risks. We plan on improving our mitigation measures against Data Protection risks

in the following areas, to target potential insufficiencies identified in the Year 2 Risk Assessment:



● Ensuring enhanced monitoring of our data systems: We will continue to invite external

monitoring agencies to audit information security and privacy security management, such as

BSI to inspect our products, development, testing and operation processes every year.



● Enhancing oversight of third parties on the Platform: We will build a Third Party Risk

Management mechanism to further enhance our oversight of Third Party data security

protection capabilities.

XI. Consumer Protection and Related Fundamental Rights



I. Risk Definition



In the Consumer Protection and Related Fundamental Rights module, we analysed the risk(s) that the

Platform functionalities may be utilised to undermine consumer rights and other related fundamental

rights of the recipients of AliExpress’s services. We have defined our scope of consumer rights

protection and other related fundamental rights protection in accordance with applicable EU laws,

including the EU Charter (2000/C364/01), with particular reference to Article 38 of the Charter. As

previously outlined in the Year 1 Report, risks incorporated in this module are particularly diverse in

nature, and are related to various types of services provided by AliExpress. In the Year 2 Report, we

have identified the following risk areas:

● Sale of products or provisions of services in infringement of consumer protection law, which

is understood as situations where a business or individual sells goods or offers services in a

manner that violates laws designed to protect consumers. These infringements include false

advertising, selling defective products, providing unfair contract terms, applying deceptive

pricing, failure to provide necessary information, and other unfair business practices that

exploit, deceive, or disadvantage consumers.

● Online stalking, which is understood as the use of digital communication tools (such as instant

messaging or commenting on product reviews) to harass, intimidate, or surveil an individual

repeatedly. This behaviour can include sending threatening messages, spreading false

information, or monitoring someone's online activities without their consent.

● Rights of the Child \& Protection of Minors, whereby the Rights of the Child include the right

to life, education, healthcare, protection from abuse and exploitation, and the right to express

their views. The protection of minors involves safeguarding children from physical, emotional,

and psychological harm, making sure their fundamental rights are upheld in all aspects of life,

including education, family, and online environments.

● Online interface design that may stimulate behavioural addictions of recipients of the

service, which is understood as the design that intentionally or unintentionally encourages

addictive behaviours in users.

● Right to effective remedy and to fair trial, which is understood as the fundamental right that

ensures individuals can seek justice when their rights have been violated. An effective remedy

includes access to a competent legal authority that can provide redress, such as compensation,

restitution, or other forms of justice. The right to a fair trial guarantees that legal proceedings

are conducted impartially, without undue delay, and with respect for the legal rights of all

parties involved, including the right to be heard and to present evidence.

● Risk to public health, which is understood as any situation, behaviour, or substance that poses

a threat to the physical and psychological health and well-being of the general population,

which includes the spread of infectious diseases, exposure to harmful environmental factors,

unsafe products, or practices that compromise the safety of food, water, air, or other essential

resources.

Non-Confidential version



51



● Freedom of expression and information, which is understood as the fundamental right that

allows individuals to freely express their thoughts, opinions, and ideas without fear of

censorship or retaliation.

● Freedom to conduct a business, which is understood as the fundamental economic right that

allows individuals and companies to pursue economic activities, establish and run businesses,

and enter into contracts without undue interference from the state or other entities. This right

includes the ability to produce, trade, and offer services in a competitive market, subject to

the laws and regulations that ensure fair competition, consumer protection, and public

interest.



II. Inherent Risk



Between Year 1 and Year 2, the Consumer Protection risk landscape has remained stable. Nonetheless,

in line with the strengthened methodology, we conducted a more in-depth analysis of how different

Platform features and factors (including those listed in Article 34(2)(a) of the DSA) may contribute to

the risk, with special attention to new features or updated features deployed on the Platform after

the Year 1 Risk Assessment.



a. Risks from Platform Design and Functionalities, including their misuse



Consistent with the analysis in the Year 1 Report, the main source of risks for consumer rights and

protection and other fundamental rights is that users, specifically sellers, may attempt to bypass

Platform rules or exploit Platform design and functionalities to unfairly benefit themselves. In the

process, they may impose financial losses or cause safety concerns for affected buyers, and may cause

financial losses on other compliant sellers too.



Malicious sellers could adopt various schemes to undermine consumers’ interests. These schemes

could occur: (i) before the transaction happens; (ii) during the transaction process; or (iii) after the

transaction takes place. Before a transaction, some sellers may try reaching out to buyers through the

IM functionality, offering buyers discounts and other benefits to trick them into conducting the

transaction outside AliExpress, where we do not have the ability to detect frauds and scams.

[Confidential].



As sellers on AliExpress compete for more exposure to potential buyers, which is affected by factors

including the historical records of sellers’ sales performance and the rating of their products and stores,

sellers may also try to manipulate these data points in order to attract more buyer traffic.

[Confidential].



There are also risks related to sellers attempting to seek access to the Platform by fraudulent means,

in order to conduct activities that harm consumer interests or other fundamental rights. [Confidential].

Account takeovers enabled by hacking may cause financial losses for the victim due to further fraud

risks.

Non-Confidential version



52



Risks related to consumer protection can also occur through unresolved disputes between sellers and

buyers on product or transaction-related issues, where either side may engage in harassing or stalking

behaviour through the use of abusive language via IM and commenting services like product reviews.



While most risks related to consumer protection and fundamental rights emerge on the side of sellers,

buyers may also abuse Platform functionalities to exploit promotional benefits. [Confidential].



AliExpress interactive games (such as “GogoMatch”, “Merge Boss” and “Farm”) and “Coins” are

designed to encourage user loyalty and interactions on the Platform with rewards, for example

through shopping coupons. While gamification is a common strategy across the industry to further

engage and provide value to users, risks could emerge around behavioural addictions for users,

including negatively affecting potential minors, who may have gained access to the Platform by

evading our controls (in contravention of our Terms and Conditions).



AliExpress requires users to confirm during the registration process that they are over 18 and agree to

our Terms \& Conditions, however there is a risk that minors may nevertheless bypass this system.

While there are prompts for visualising sensitive content and extensive moderation of prohibited

items, the Platform still hosts potentially inappropriate for minors but compliant products, such as

adult toys, sexual costumes, and sexual content.



b. Risks from Other Factors of the Platform (in line with Article 34(2) of the DSA)



Both in Year 1 and Year 2, we have assessed how the factors listed in Article 34(2) of the DSA may

influence IPR risks:



● Advertising systems and data practices: There is an inherent risk that fraudulent sellers create

unrealistic promotion schemes with prices much lower than the regular market value to drive

up views on their advertisements. Furthermore, the advertisement customisation features

developed by the Platform allow sellers to target certain buyer groups (albeit not in a precise

manner). This could potentially trigger risks to consumer rights protection, as it may exclude

certain buyers from equally accessing benefits provided by sellers in marketing campaigns,

even if these benefits are still available to them upon proactive searching. While it is not

possible to assess the full scale of these risks, the historical volume of detected infringements

can serve as a proxy for this particular risk. Among the 2,764,070 product listings removed by

the Platform due to fraudulent advertising campaigns in the time period from 1 July 2023 to

30 June 2024, 399,303 ([Confidential]) infringing product listings were advertised.

● Recommender system: The recommender system on the Platform is tuned to buyers’

behaviour patterns, which include their clicks, likes, and purchase history. Some sellers may

resort to unfair tactics in an attempt to boost their exposure in the Platform’s recommender

system by manipulating relevant data points. [Confidential].

● Relevant policies and their enforcement: Rules and policies published by AliExpress may not

cover all types of scenarios of potentially fraudulent behaviour by users, thereby affecting our

ability to take disciplinary action against such users to protect consumer interests and related

fundamental rights.

Non-Confidential version



53



● Content moderation systems: Even though the content moderation system serves to mitigate

risks to consumer rights and other related fundamental rights, flaws in its functioning can also

contribute to these risks. For instance, inaccurate screening of suspicious products, content,

or accounts by algorithms may lead to unfair penalties against users. Taking the enforcement

of sellers for IPR infringement as an example, between 1 July 2023 and 30 June 2024, out of a

total of 2,764,070 appeals received, there were 28,556 (1.03%) successful appeals against our

enforcement for IPR infringements.



Given that AliExpress operates as a marketplace, the potential theoretical risk—assuming no controls

are in place—of violations of consumer rights and other related fundamental rights is “High”. While it

is not possible to measure the risk without any controls in place, this risk can be estimated by

considering the following proxies. Between 1 July 2023 and 30 June 2024:



● We closed 297 fraudulent stores [Confidential].

● The number of EU buyers who did not get refunds through disputes associated with fraudulent

sellers was 26,562, [Confidential].

● We received 7,279 reports of suspicious account takeover cases.



III. Existing Mitigations



In Year 2, we continued operating strong control mechanisms and further enhanced our consumer

protection controls through our Year 1 mitigation commitments. The measures to manage risks

related to Consumer protection and related fundamental rights can be grouped into several key areas:

the tools developed for proactive risk mitigation, the task force and its management, internal and

external risk identification methods, and the relevant risk mitigation workflows.



a. Transaction Specific Controls



AliExpress has developed a comprehensive risk-control framework that covers risks emerging from

pre-transaction stage to after-transaction stage. Automatic keyword detection has been applied in the

IM feature. Personal contact information and blacklisted keywords will be immediately blocked in

order to prevent guided off-Platform transactions for non-compliant products, as well as to prevent

malicious harassment and online stalking.



During the transaction, the Platform also has proactive measures to detect abnormal surges of order

amounts or delivery declaration, as well as mechanisms to detect invalid order details or logistics

details entered into the system. To further safeguard the transaction process, we also work with

payment service providers to prevent theft of cards and other payment methods and to prevent

leakage of payment channel information.



After the completion of a transaction, we will monitor for any user report of delivery or product quality

issues, including keeping a record of “Not Received” rates and “Send Not As Described” rates for each

seller. We also set up proactive reminders for buyers to report potential infringement of their

Non-Confidential version



54



consumer rights, and provide them with easily accessible return and refund options. For example, in

cases of the ordered product failing to be delivered within the promised time period, we will

proactively send a notification to the user, and we will advise the user to initiate a dispute if necessary.

When more severe situations occur, such as confirmed frauds and scams or sales of dangerous illegal

products, the Platform will initiate proactive closure or confirmed fraudulent transactions, and follow

local authorities' requirements regarding product recalls.



As an online marketplace, AliExpress has always stressed the need for quality control of products sold

on the Platform. In addition to mitigation measures addressed in the P\&C Products module, we have

also developed pertinent measures to prevent products of inferior quality from being listed on the

Platform in order to safeguard consumers’ interests. For example, we implement monitoring and

quality control measures (such as by identifying products with insufficient or misleading product

information) and conduct thorough analysis of the price composition factors of individual products to

detect misleading pricing. We also establish strict guidelines for the title, category, attribute

parameters and detailed product descriptions to control for misleading or insufficient product

descriptions.



b. Account Related Controls



We also adopt targeted measures to protect sellers registered on the Platform. AliExpress proactively

identifies and intercepts attempts from high-risk buyer accounts, determined by scanning for bot

behaviour, abnormal device information and IPs, that are more likely to unfairly claim vouchers and

exploit other promotional benefits Further, to enhance its detection against fraud, AliExpress

maintains credit profiles of sellers who have been previously detected as having participated in

manipulating product reviews as well as for buyers who have been previously detected as having

abused the interactive game features built into the Platform for user rewards.



For more severe risks identified above such as re-entry attempts from blacklisted sellers, account

takeovers, and recidivism of deceptive behaviours from sellers, we operate a tracking system for these

accounts, as well as a database of fraudulent account holder information. Thanks to this tracking

system, we are able to impose enforcement actions against recidivist accounts effectively.



c. Vulnerable Population Related Controls



For vulnerable population groups, we set up special measures to protect them on the Platform.

Regarding people with disabilities, AliExpress follows the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines in the

Platform design, which allows users to enter the accessibility mode by selecting the help directory on

the website homepage or turning on the accessibility mode in the mobile’s device’s setting when using

the mobile application.



d. Protection of Minors



As stipulated in our Terms and Conditions, we do not provide services to minors (Individuals under the

age of 18), and have specific restrictions on account registration and the use of payment methods.

Non-Confidential version



55



When registering an account, users are clearly reminded that they must be 18 years or older.

Additionally, the requirement for valid payment methods acts as a further control mechanism. When

users attempt to make a purchase, they must provide a valid credit card or another accepted payment

method, which typically requires the user to be 18 years or older. This requirement helps mitigate the

risk of minors completing transactions on our platform. In addition to our controls on minors creating

accounts on AliExpress, we currently have two types of age-restricted visibility mechanisms to mitigate

the risk of users (including potential minors) encountering sensitive products such as adult products

when accessing the Platform as a guest (i.e., without an account). Specifically, the Platform has the

following features:



● Age-verification mechanism: The age-verification mechanism appears as a pop-up window

prompting confirmation that the user is over 18 years old when their search information or

search terms relate to certain product categories (e.g., adult products); and

● Adult products blurring control mechanism for browsing: Adult product listings (including,

but not limited to, adult sex products etc.) will appear blurred first, until the user confirms

they want to see them. As our policies do not allow minors on the service, this control is for

all users. However, the control can protect minors should they access the service by bypassing

our controls or should they be exposed to platform content if their parents or legal guardians

are browsing the Platform in the company of a minor.

The above are additional control capabilities for protecting minors. These are without prejudice to the

Platform rules which already restrict pornographic or other explicit or inappropriate content.



Additionally, we established and have maintained a SOP allowing parents to report cases of underage

use. If a parent requests, or if the Platform confirms that a user is a minor, the user’s account will be

frozen. From 4 September 2023 to 30 June 2024, AliExpress received one DSR from parents based in

the EU, and the concerned account had been thus successfully deleted following verification with the

parents.



e. Interactive Games



The Platform has implemented comprehensive anti-fraud strategies for interactive games. Each time

a user initiates a request in an interactive game (such as entering a game, completing tasks, or claiming

rewards), the system intercepts users flagged as high risk. This strategy includes identifying users

based on machine traffic, devices, IP addresses, and other mediums. If suspicious activity is detected,

the Platform will block the user's current request to participate in the interactive game. This measure

aims to prevent the mass claiming of platform benefits by malicious entities, thereby ensuring that

legitimate users have fair access to the Platform's resources and protecting their rights.



The AliExpress Interactive Game Management Guidelines have been established in light of

requirements regarding interactive game policies and regulations across countries. These guidelines

aim to ensure the compliance of AliExpress’ interactive games, and make sure that games undergo

compliance and user experience evaluations before launch, modification, or removal. The Guidelines

include two major requirements as governance controls:

● Any game must be approved by the legal and other relevant teams;

Non-Confidential version



56



● The global Terms and Conditions (T\&C) must be localised to ensure compliance within each

relevant regional market or national market where applicable.



We also track the amount of time users spend on AliExpress’ interactive games to understand the

potential link to promoting addiction and monitor that the percentage of users spending significant

time on such games remain below certain thresholds.



f. Advertising Systems and Data Practices



Since advertisements on the Platform are distributed using algorithms, there is a risk of unequal

exposure for sellers participating in the Platform's targeted advertising programmes. To address this,

we have implemented specific checks to prevent algorithmic discrimination within the advertising

systems. Relevant sellers can choose between two advertising modes: “System-Intelligently Placed

Ads” and “Custom Placed Ads.” In the first mode, sellers specify the products to advertise, the

countries or regions to target, and their campaign budget. However, neither the sellers nor the

Platform can select specific buyer groups to target for seeing the ads. In the second mode, sellers can

customise the buyer groups for their ads, but this customisation does not guarantee that the ads will

be shown exclusively to the specified buyer groups.



We have also implemented a strict admission procedure for sellers to participate in the Platform’s

advertising programs, including but not limited to ensuring that sellers are not involved in dishonest

operations, buyer fraud, or any other behaviour that harms buyer rights and interests. The Advertising

pool is directly connected to the CRO department controls and the database of confirmed non-

compliant products. Products targeted by the CRO department controls or labelled in that database

will be automatically removed from the advertising pool, in order to safeguard users’ experiences with

the recommendation system on the Platform.



Given that the advertisement system on the Platform is powered by a recommender system, we

established the Advertising Transparency Repository for the mandatory disclosure of advertisement

information in compliance with the requirements in Article 39 (2) points (a) to (g) of the DSA. This

Repository is publicly available and does not require user log-in. The Advertising Transparency

Repository portal can be easily accessed through the “Tools” section and the “DSA-related Information”

section of our site, which can both be accessed through the “Transparency Centre” located at the

bottom of the interface of the AliExpress homepage. Since the establishment of the Repository,

AliExpress has been continuously improving its accessibility. On 16 May 2024, AliExpress added an

access point to the API in the Advertising Transparency Repository portal, along with API guidelines

and FAQs that further help users understand how to use the search query tool as well as the API.



g. Recommender System



Along with the Recommendation system controls laid out in Section VI, the following are filtered from

the recommendation pool to ensure that they will not appear as recommended items on the

AliExpress Homepage: sexually suggestive content; adult products; potentially provoking or

controversial content (e.g., products featuring skulls and blood); products featuring controlled drugs

Non-Confidential version



57



(e.g., clothing with patterns of cannabis); and content or products with unverified IPR claims. Apart

from non-compliant products and non-compliant content, we also limit the presence of poorly rated

products on users’ recommendation scenarios. The recommendation pool is directly connected to the

CRO department controls and the database of confirmed non-compliant products. Products targeted

by the CRO department controls or labelled in that database will be automatically removed from the

recommendation pool, in order to safeguard users’ experiences with the recommendation system on

the Platform.



h. Relevant Policies and their Enforcement



We closely monitor developments in consumer protection laws within the European Union and its

member states to ensure our terms and conditions address potential risk scenarios, emerging user

trends, and align with relevant EU and member state legal requirements. As outlined in our Year 1

Report, AliExpress provides a number of detailed policies and rules regarding Consumer Protection.

Our list of rules for P\&C products include:

● AliExpress “Transaction but Not Selling” Rules;

● AliExpress “Guided Offline Trading” Rules;

● AliExpress “Disrupting Platform Order” Rules;

● AliExpress “Fake Shipment Rules”;

● AliExpress “Mismatched Merchandise” Rules;

● AliExpress “Malicious Harassment Rules”.



Violations of these policies may lead to the imposition of penalty points, following a similar approach

as laid out in the Prohibited \& Controlled Products section (See Section VII of the report).



i. Content Moderation Systems



For content moderation algorithms, we continuously monitor and adjust detection thresholds based

on actual violations. These thresholds are iteratively improved using data from violations that were

not detected by the algorithmic controls, thereby enhancing the algorithms' ability to identify non-

compliant content and products.



Another area of focus is the prevention of fake ratings and reviews. AliExpress leverages big data

analysis and artificial intelligence tools to detect abnormal patterns in reviews, such as timing

anomalies or content similarities, and flag them as potentially fake. The Platform has also refined its

rules to explicitly prohibit fake reviews and set clear enforcement actions for merchants who engage

in this practice. This includes deducting points from merchant ratings, removing products from listings

and, in severe cases, suspending or closing accounts. A reporting mechanism is also in place, enabling

users to report suspicious reviews, which are promptly investigated by the Platform.



On the staffing side, we ensure the moderation team can handle tasks effectively by monitoring the

timeliness of their work and adjusting shifts and staffing as needed. If task volume exceeds current

Non-Confidential version



58



capacity, additional resources will be allocated. To maintain accuracy in manual reviews, we conduct

random quality inspections. Moderators who fail to meet quality standards must retake qualification

exams before continuing their duties.



As all content moderation operations take place on the AliExpress Risk Control System ([Confidential]),

we have set up early warning mechanisms in place across all stages of making and enforcing a

moderation decision. Regular risk inspection sampling is carried out to identify potential system

failures, and any issues detected in the sampling will be promptly addressed by responsible personnel.

Different types of risks (e.g., content, products, transactions, marketing) are completely separated in

their moderation in the Risk Control system, which prevents system failures in one cluster of risk type

interfering with other clusters, and improves the overall resilience of the system.



Given that there is always the risk of inaccurate moderation decisions being made, we provide users

with easy-to-use appeal procedures to challenge moderation decisions. For EU-based sellers, if there

is any doubt regarding the penalty received, sellers can seek assistance from the Platform's customer

service portal to appeal against the decision, in line with article 20 of the DSA. The seller should then

provide the required materials within the prescribed time frame and the appeal case will be

transferred to the CRO for re-examination. Currently, [Confidential] customer service representatives

are dedicated to assisting EU-based sellers, providing responses in Spanish, French, Polish, and English.



j. New Mitigation Measures



In line with Year 1 commitments, we have, in the past twelve months, made significant improvements

to the effectiveness of our mitigation measures. Notably:

● Choice model: In addition to the P\&C and IPR risks that the Choice service mitigates as

discussed in the earlier sections, Choice also promotes consumer protection as it can

guarantee faster, safer, and more economic deliveries for consumers as compared to non-

Choice products sold by other sellers. Also, Choice has a 90-day free return period for most

products and buyers can also benefit from a faster and smoother after sale care process as

buyers engage directly with customer service representatives from AliExpress on behalf of the

sellers.

● Updates to published platform rules: We have launched the AliExpress "Product Review"

Rules, available in both Chinese and English. In the latest update to the "Product Review"

Rules, we have specifically addressed the issue of manipulating product reviews and ratings.

The practice of offering “incentivised reviews” is now officially subject to content moderation,

aiming to further reduce potentially falsified and manipulated reviews. Additionally, we have

updated the AliExpress “Seller Shipping Management Standards” by introducing new

assessment criteria. These include the seller’s 48-hour shipment rate (sellers are expected to

ship the order within 48 hours after payment of the order being completed), order

cancellation rate, and Not Received (“NR”) dispute rate. The goal is to improve the consumer

shopping experience by ensuring that sellers ship orders on time and deliver products more

quickly.

● Strengthened fraudulent user identification: We have enhanced our systems to better detect

and prevent fraudulent user activities. The expansion of our database of recognised

Non-Confidential version



59



fraudulent activities and the improved training of detection algorithms have led to more

accurate identification of suspicious attempts. Additionally, the continuous updates to our

blacklisted merchants’ backflow prevention system, coupled with new detection tools, have

improved our ability to identify fraudulent sellers trying to obtain legitimate seller accounts

by refining our systems to more effectively filter out suspicious login activities.

● Optimised customer reporting and dispute resolution tools: In August 2024, we introduced

new hotline services in Spain and France, expanded local language support hours, and

integrated user feedback into our detection mechanisms to improve the customer experience

and reduce the risk of unresolved disputes.

● Expanded local language support: In response to the needs of our global user base, we have

extended the availability of local language support by implementing AI translation technology.

Going live in September, this will allow our 24/7 English chat service to be translated into local

languages, which supports translation to Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, German, French,

and Polish.

● Enhanced detection of inauthentic activities: We have further developed our capabilities to

identify and mitigate the risks associated with fake accounts and fraudulent user reviews.

[Confidential].

● Continuous improvement to the detection and verification algorithms: We remain

committed to advancing our detection and verification technologies. In Year 2, we have

developed more sophisticated recognition algorithms, particularly for detecting commonly

sold counterfeited goods. We have also expanded our historical data analysis, allowing for

more accurate identification of high-risk accounts. Stricter enforcement measures against

repeat offenders, particularly in cases of fake shipments, have been implemented, to further

deter fraudulent activities.

● Enhanced protections regarding minors: We have reinforced our safeguards by launching the

adult products blurring control mechanism for browsing related products. Additionally, we

established standardised procedures to freeze accounts upon confirmed parental requests,

reducing the risk of unauthorised access by underage users.



IV. Residual Risk



Despite our best efforts to mitigate the risks to Consumer protection and related fundamental rights

on the Platform through proactive and reactive measures, we cannot fully eliminate the risks entirely

due to the dynamic nature of the risk landscape. Our efforts to mitigate risk are made more complex

by the evolving strategies utilised by users to manipulate the transaction process. Consequently, it is

evident that a certain level of residual risks persists on the Platform. Based on the inherent risk score

and mitigation effectiveness score of this risk module, the residual risk score is qualified as Medium-

High. Nonetheless, we continue to work towards minimising the risk of disseminating P\&C Products

through the Platform.



Inherent Risk Mitigation Effectiveness Score Residual Risks

Non-Confidential version



60



Based on the probability and

severity scores calculated using

the DSA Risk Assessment Rating

Methodology, the inherent risk

score is assessed as “High”,

which indicates a high concern

around the probability of risks

occurring that may have the

potential to cause significant

negative impact to the users.



Overall, the mitigation

implementations are effective

and resulted in a decreased

exposure of related risk on the

Platform.



The mitigation effectiveness

score is calculated to be

“Moderate” (66%), indicating a

minor likelihood of a control

failure.



Based on the inherent risk

score and mitigation

effectiveness score, the

residual risk is “Medium-High”

on the Platform, which

indicates a moderately high

level of concern around the

likelihood and impact of risks

arising to users on the Platform

after mitigation measures have

been applied.



V. Conclusion and Future Mitigations



In Year 2, the residual risk rating of “Medium-High” has increased from a “Medium” rating in Year 1.

This change is due to our updated methodology assigning a higher severity score to this category,

resulting in an elevated residual risk score. We highlight that this increase in residual risk occurred

despite improvements to our mitigation effectiveness score from Year 1.



We will continue to build up from the residual risk mitigation roadmap committed to in Year 1, to

address the residual risks. We plan on improving our mitigation measures against Consumer

Protection risks in the following areas, to target potential insufficiencies identified in the Year 2 Risk

Assessment:



● Strengthening fraudulent user’s identification: We will enhance security by introducing a

“Card Payment Order Verification” method and implementing the “Account Freeze” action to

safeguard accounts that have been compromised.

● Enhancing detection of fraudulent seller behaviour: We plan to identify more fraudulent

merchants by working with third-party logistics data providers thus gaining access to more

comprehensive and higher-quality logistics data to detect and prevent suspicious activities

more effectively.

● Improving detection of malicious harassment by sellers: We will increase our ability to

recognise consumer abuse by expanding keyword recognition coverage, enabling us to better

identify and address instances of harassment or insults from sellers.

XII. Conclusion



This report highlights the result of AliExpress’ second DSA systemic risk assessment exercise, carried

out in line with the obligations set forth in Articles 34 and 35 of the DSA. Building on the foundational

work established in the first risk assessment, we have, in our Year 2 risk assessment, refined our

approach, enabling us to build on the insights gained from our Year 1 assessment to more precisely

map specific risks that may arise across the Platform and evaluate the effectiveness of the controls we

have implemented.



For our Year 2 assessment, we diligently identified, analysed and assessed the systemic risks in the

Union stemming from the design or functioning of our services and its related systems, including

algorithmic systems, or from the use made of our services. As AliExpress operates within a dynamic

and fast-paced risk landscape common to many global online marketplaces where the transactions,

types of sellers and buyers are increasing in volume and diversity, we focused on the risks that are

specific to our service and divided our analysis into five separate modules allowing us to take into

account the severity and probability of these systemic risks arising on or through our Platform. We

assessed how our Platform could be used to disseminate prohibited and controlled products, illegal

content, IPR infringements as well as to produce negative effects on consumer and data protection

among other fundamental rights.



We then assessed the strengths of our existing control measures, outlining improvements made in the

past year, following the results of our Year 1 DSA risk assessment. Overall, the analysis shows the

strength of our approach, which is evidenced by an overall reduction in residual risk levels compared

to Year 1. Nevertheless, it is inevitable that some residual risk will remain on our Platform as we

operate in a dynamic risk landscape. To ensure we continue to effectively monitor and mitigate these

risks, we remain committed to improving our controls and have, in each section, detailed how we plan

to take additional reasonable, proportionate and effective measures in the next year, tailored to the

specific systemic risks we have identified in our Year 2 assessment.



We look forward to continuing to collaborate closely with the European Commission, external

researchers, and civil society to ensure that AliExpress remains a safe, stable, and trustworthy

environment for all our users.

Annex 4. Mitigation effectiveness scores and relevant descriptions



For the Year 2 Mitigation effectiveness assessment questionnaire, we have adopted the mitigation

maturity assessment as developed in the DTSP Maturity Rating Scale. The scale was implemented as

follows:



Maturity Scale Definition of Maturity Rating



Ad-hoc

Execution of mitigation measures are incomplete, informal, and inconsistent.



Processes are not defined, not repeatable, and should be improved.



Repeatable



Execution of mitigation measures do not have standardised processes in places. There

is some observability on how the measure works.



There is scope of improving and formalising documentation practices.



Defined



Execution of mitigation measures entails processes that are defined and documented.



Processes are more proactive than reactive and are implemented across the

organisation.



Managed



Execution of mitigation measures entails processes that are defined, documented and

managed through regular reviews.



There is a set process for integrating feedback to mitigate process deficiencies.



Optimised



Execution of mitigation measures entails processes that are comprehensively defined

and operating at the highest quality, with mature quality assurance in place.



Processes are continuously improved to maximise the effectiveness of resources,

maintain resilience and robustness.
